In this paper, we develop an analytical\nframework for the evaluation of the coverage probability, or equivalently the\ncomplementary cumulative density function (CCDF) of\nsignal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR), of a typical user in a K-tier\nHetNet under a max power-based association strategy, where the BS locations of\neach tier follow either a Poisson point process (PPP) or a PCP. The key\nenabling step involves conditioning on the parent PPPs of all the PCPs which\nallows us to express the coverage probability as a product of sum-product and\nprobability generating functionals (PGFLs) of the parent PPPs. In addition to\nseveral useful insights, our analysis provides a rigorous way to study the\nimpact of the cluster size on the SINR distribution, which was not possible\nusing existing PPP-based models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Dec 2018 06:44:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-06", "authors_parsed": [["Saha", "Chiranjib", ""], ["Dhillon", "Harpreet S.", ""], ["Miyoshi", "Naoto", ""], ["Andrews", "Jeffrey G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.01947", "submitter": "Renaud-Alexandre Pitaval", "authors": "Renaud-Alexandre Pitaval", "title": "Channel Shortening by Large Multiantenna Precoding in OFDM", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on Communications, 2021", "doi": "10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3056117", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A channel delay spread larger than the cyclic prefix (CP) creates\ninter-carrier/symbol interference (ISI/ICI) in orthogonal frequency-division\nmultiplexing (OFDM).

This frequency-domain precoding method, coined time-frequency (TF)\nprecoding, is compared to time-reversal (TR) filtering whose asymptotic rate is\noptimal but introduces post-modulation processing with channel-dependent signal\ndistortion. In addition to maintain the legacy precoded multi-antenna OFDM\nstructure, finite-size analysis shows that TF-precoding converges faster to its\nasymptotic rate than TR-filtering, so that TF-precoding can outperform\nTRfiltering in the high-SNR regime with not-so-many antennas.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Dec 2018 12:11:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 23 May 2019 14:33:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 22 Apr 2020 09:17:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 11 Feb 2021 10:30:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-12", "authors_parsed": [["Pitaval", "Renaud-Alexandre", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.02030", "submitter": "Dongzhu Liu", "authors": "Dongzhu Liu, Guangxu Zhu, Jun Zhang and Kaibin Huang", "title": "Wireless Data Acquisition for Edge Learning: Data-Importance Aware\n  Retransmission", "comments": "This is an updated version: 1) extension to general classifiers; 2)\n  consideration of imbalanced classification in the experiments.

Along this direction, we consider the specific\nproblem of retransmission decision in each communication round to ensure both\nreliability and quantity of those training data for accelerating model\nconvergence. To solve the problem, a new retransmission protocol called\ndata-importance aware automatic-repeat-request (importance ARQ) is proposed.\nUnlike the classic ARQ focusing merely on reliability, importance ARQ\nselectively retransmits a data sample based on its uncertainty which helps\nlearning and can be measured using the model under training. Underpinning the\nproposed protocol is a derived elegant communication-learning relation between\ntwo corresponding metrics, i.e., signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and data\nuncertainty. This relation facilitates the design of a simple threshold based\npolicy for importance ARQ. The policy is first derived based on the classic\nclassifier model of support vector machine (SVM), where the uncertainty of a\ndata sample is measured by its distance to the decision boundary. The policy is\nthen extended to the more complex model of convolutional neural networks (CNN)\nwhere data uncertainty is measured by entropy.

In the first part of the\nthesis we focus on hypothesis testing.

In the former setting, we prove a composite quantum Stein's Lemma. We\nalso discuss how this gives an operational interpretation to several quantities\nof interest. For the latter, we give the optimal asymptotic error rates in\nseveral symmetric and asymmetric settings, and discuss properties and examples\nof these rates.\n  In the second part, the focus is shifted to entropy inequalities. We start\nwith recoverability inequalities. Using tools developed to prove the composite\nStein's Lemma, we give a strengthened lower bound on the conditional quantum\nmutual information (CQMI). Next, we give an operational interpretation to the\nrelative entropy of recovery via hypothesis testing. Then, we discuss some\nrecent counterexamples, which show that the relative entropy of recovery is not\na lower bound on the CQMI; we provide more counterexamples where some systems\nare classical.\n  We then turn to a seemingly different type of entropy inequalities called\nbounds on information combining. Using a particular recoverability inequality,\nwe give a lower bound and additionally conjecture optimal lower and upper\nbounds. Furthermore, we discuss implications of our bounds to the finite\nblocklength behavior of Polar codes.\n  Finally, we discuss Renyi-$2$ entropy inequalities for Gaussian states, by\nexploiting their formulation as log-det inequalities to find recoverability\nrelated bounds on several quantities.

These age optimality\nresults hold for (i) general data freshness metrics represented by monotonic\nfunctions of the age of information, (ii) general service time distributions of\nthe queueing server, (iii) both continuoustime and discrete-time sampling\nproblems, and (iv) sampling problems both with and without the sampling rate\nconstraint. Numerical results suggest that the optimal sampling policies can be\nmuch better than zero-wait sampling and the classic uniform sampling.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Dec 2018 08:51:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 31 Dec 2018 22:11:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 27 Apr 2019 07:11:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 3 May 2019 08:10:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-06", "authors_parsed": [["Sun", "Yin", ""], ["Cyr", "Benjamin", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.07253", "submitter": "Bho Matthiesen", "authors": "Bho Matthiesen, Eduard A.

The main issue is that the computational complexity of\nthese problems grows exponentially in the number of variables instead of\npolynomially as for many convex optimization problems. However, often the\nnon-convexity stems only from a subset of variables. Conventional global\noptimization frameworks like monotonic optimization or DC programming treat all\nvariables as global variables and require complicated, problem specific\ndecomposition approaches to exploit the convexity in some variables. To\novercome this challenge, we develop an easy-to-use algorithm that inherently\ndifferentiates between convex and non-convex variables, preserving the low\ncomputational complexity in the number of convex variables. Another issue with\nthese widely used frameworks is that they may suffer from severe numerical\nproblems. We discuss this issue in detail and provide a clear motivating\nexample.

Machine learning-based methods have\nrecently emerged as a disruptive way to obtain near-optimal performance for\nMINLPs with affordable computational complexity. There have been some attempts\nin applying such methods to resource management in wireless networks, but these\nattempts require huge amounts of training samples and lack the capability to\nhandle constrained problems. Furthermore, they suffer from severe performance\ndeterioration when the network parameters change, which commonly happens and is\nreferred to as the task mismatch problem. In this paper, to reduce the sample\ncomplexity and address the feasibility issue, we propose a framework of\nLearning to Optimize for Resource Management (LORM). Instead of the end-to-end\nlearning approach adopted in previous studies, LORM learns the optimal pruning\npolicy in the branch-and-bound algorithm for MINLPs via a sample-efficient\nmethod, namely, imitation learning. To further address the task mismatch\nproblem, we develop a transfer learning method via self-imitation in LORM,\nnamed LORM-TL, which can quickly adapt a pre-trained machine learning model to\nthe new task with only a few additional unlabeled training samples. Numerical\nsimulations will demonstrate that LORM outperforms specialized state-of-the-art\nalgorithms and achieves near-optimal performance, while achieving significant\nspeedup compared with the branch-and-bound algorithm. Moreover, LORM-TL, by\nrelying on a few unlabeled samples, achieves comparable performance with the\nmodel trained from scratch with sufficient labeled samples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Dec 2018 07:18:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 16 May 2019 03:12:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-17", "authors_parsed": [["Shen", "Yifei", ""], ["Shi", "Yuanming", ""], ["Zhang", "Jun", ""], ["Letaief", "Khaled B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.08106", "submitter": "Hsin-Po Wang", "authors": "Hsin-Po Wang and Iwan Duursma", "title": "Log-logarithmic Time Pruned Polar Coding on Binary Erasure Channels", "comments": "16 pages, 144 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A pruned variant of polar coding is reinvented for all binary erasure\nchannels.

In particular, we focus\non the strong spatial correlation regimes where the covariance matrix of each\nuser channel vector has a rank that scales sublinearly with the number of base\nstation antennas, as the latter grows to infinity. We also consider the case\nwhere the covariance eigenvectors corresponding to the non-zero eigenvalues\nspan randomly selected subspaces. For this channel model, referred to as the\n\"random sparse angular support\" model, we characterize the asymptotic capacity\nscaling law in the limit of large number of antennas. To achieve the asymptotic\ncapacity results, statistical spatial despreading based on the second-order\nchannel statistics plays a pivotal role in terms of pilot decontamination and\ninterference suppression. A remarkable result is that even when the number of\nusers scales linearly with base station antennas, a linear growth of the\ncapacity with respect to the number of antennas is achievable under the sparse\nangular support model. We note that the achievable rate lower bound based on\nmassive MIMO \"channel hardening\", widely used in the massive MIMO literature,\nyields rather loose results in the strong spatial correlation regimes and may\nsignificantly underestimate the achievable rate of massive MIMO. This work\ntherefore considers an alternative bounding technique which is better suited to\nthe strong correlation regimes.

Related to non-stabilizer state manipulation is\nthe resource theory of non-stabilizer states, for which one of the goals is to\ncharacterize and quantify non-stabilizerness of a quantum state. In this paper,\nwe introduce the family of thauma measures to quantify the amount of\nnon-stabilizerness in a quantum state, and we exploit this family of measures\nto address several open questions in the resource theory of non-stabilizer\nstates. As a first application, we establish the hypothesis testing thauma as\nan efficiently computable benchmark for the one-shot distillable\nnon-stabilizerness, which in turn leads to a variety of bounds on the rate at\nwhich non-stabilizerness can be distilled, as well as on the overhead of\nmagic-state distillation. We then prove that the max-thauma can be used as an\nefficiently computable tool in benchmarking the efficiency of magic-state\ndistillation and that it can outperform pervious approaches based on mana.\nFinally, we use the min-thauma to bound a quantity known in the literature as\nthe \"regularized relative entropy of magic.\" As a consequence of this bound, we\nfind that two classes of states with maximal mana, a previously established\nnon-stabilizerness measure, cannot be interconverted in the asymptotic regime\nat a rate equal to one.

Such attacks influence inference algorithms\nby tampering with the mechanism through which the algorithm is provided with\nthe statistical model of the population about which an inferential decision is\nmade. Causative attacks are viable, for instance, by contaminating the\nhistorical or training data, or by compromising an expert who provides the\nmodel. In the presence of causative attacks, the inference algorithms operate\nunder a distorted statistical model for the population from which they collect\ndata samples. This paper introduces specific notions of secure estimation and\nprovides a framework under which secure estimation under causative attacks can\nbe formulated. A central premise underlying the secure estimation framework is\nthat forming secure estimates introduces a new dimension to the estimation\nobjective, which pertains to detecting attacks and isolating the true model.\nSince detection and isolation decisions are imperfect, their inclusion induces\nan inherent coupling between the desired secure estimation objective and the\nauxiliary detection and isolation decisions that need to be formed in\nconjunction with the estimates.

Thereby, \"interference\" is\nharnessed to provide fast implementation of the model aggregation. This results\nin dramatical latency reduction compared with the traditional orthogonal access\n(i.e., OFDMA). In this work, the performance of FEEL is characterized targeting\na single-cell random network. First, due to power alignment between devices as\nrequired for aggregation, a fundamental tradeoff is shown to exist between the\nupdate-reliability and the expected update-truncation ratio. This motivates the\ndesign of an opportunistic scheduling scheme for FEEL that selects devices\nwithin a distance threshold. This scheme is shown using real datasets to yield\nsatisfactory learning performance in the presence of high mobility. Second,\nboth the multi-access latency of the proposed analog aggregation and the OFDMA\nscheme are analyzed. Their ratio, which quantifies the latency reduction of the\nformer, is proved to scale almost linearly with device population.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Dec 2018 09:09:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 14 Jan 2019 11:25:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 16 Jan 2019 07:11:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-17", "authors_parsed": [["Zhu", "Guangxu", ""], ["Wang", "Yong", ""], ["Huang", "Kaibin", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.11584", "submitter": "Mahdi Nangir", "authors": "Mahdi Nangir, Reza Asvadi, Jun Chen, Mahmoud Ahmadian-Attari, and Tad\n  Matsumoto", "title": "Successive Wyner-Ziv Coding for the Binary CEO Problem under Logarithmic\n  Loss", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The $L$-link binary Chief Executive Officer (CEO) problem under logarithmic\nloss is investigated in this paper.

Instead,\nedge machine learning becomes increasingly attractive for performing training\nand inference directly at network edges without sending data to a centralized\ndata center. This stimulates a nascent field termed as federated learning for\ntraining a machine learning model on computation, storage, energy and bandwidth\nlimited mobile devices in a distributed manner. To preserve data privacy and\naddress the issues of unbalanced and non-IID data points across different\ndevices, the federated averaging algorithm has been proposed for global model\naggregation by computing the weighted average of locally updated model at each\nselected device. However, the limited communication bandwidth becomes the main\nbottleneck for aggregating the locally computed updates. We thus propose a\nnovel over-the-air computation based approach for fast global model aggregation\nvia exploring the superposition property of a wireless multiple-access channel.\nThis is achieved by joint device selection and beamforming design, which is\nmodeled as a sparse and low-rank optimization problem to support efficient\nalgorithms design. To achieve this goal, we provide a\ndifference-of-convex-functions (DC) representation for the sparse and low-rank\nfunction to enhance sparsity and accurately detect the fixed-rank constraint in\nthe procedure of device selection.

This\nraises the following important questions: 1) why most opinion polls were not\naccurate in 2016? and 2) how to improve the accuracies of opinion polls? In\nthis paper, we study the inaccuracies of opinion polls in the 2016 election\nthrough the lens of information theory. We first propose a general framework of\nparameter estimation, called clean sensing (polling), which performs optimal\nparameter estimation with sensing cost constraints, from heterogeneous and\npotentially distorted data sources. We then cast the opinion polling as a\nproblem of parameter estimation from potentially distorted heterogeneous data\nsources, and derive the optimal polling strategy using heterogenous and\npossibly distorted data under cost constraints. Our results show that a larger\nnumber of data samples do not necessarily lead to better polling accuracy,\nwhich give a possible explanation of the inaccuracies of opinion polls in 2016.\nThe optimal sensing strategy should instead optimally allocate sensing\nresources over heterogenous data sources according to several factors including\ndata quality, and, moreover, for a particular data source, it should strike an\noptimal balance between the quality of data samples, and the quantity of data\nsamples.\n  As a byproduct of this research, in a general setting, we derive a group of\nnew lower bounds on the mean-squared errors of general unbiased and biased\nparameter estimators. These new lower bounds can be tighter than the classical\nCram\\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) and Chapman-Robbins bound. Our derivations are via\nstudying the Lagrange dual problems of certain convex programs. The classical\nCram\\'{e}r-Rao bound and Chapman-Robbins bound follow naturally from our\nresults for special cases of these convex programs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Dec 2018 16:41:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Weiyu", ""], ["Lai", "Lifeng", ""], ["Khajehnejad", "Amin", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.11942", "submitter": "Han Cai", "authors": "Han Cai, Ying Miao, Moshe Schwartz, and Xiaohu Tang", "title": "On Optimal Locally Repairable Codes with Super-Linear Length", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Locally repairable codes which are optimal with respect to the bound\npresented by Prakash et al. are considered.
