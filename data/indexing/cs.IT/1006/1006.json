It is known\nthat this problem is inherently unstable against noise, and to overcome this\ninstability, the authors of [Stable Recovery; Donoho et.al., 2006] have\nproposed to use an \"approximate\" decomposition, that is, a decomposition\nsatisfying ||x - A s|| < \\delta, rather than satisfying the exact equality x =\nAs. Then, they have shown that if there is a decomposition with ||s||_0 <\n(1+M^{-1})/2, where M denotes the coherence of the dictionary, this\ndecomposition would be stable against noise. On the other hand, it is known\nthat a sparse decomposition with ||s||_0 < spark(A)/2 is unique. In other\nwords, although a decomposition with ||s||_0 < spark(A)/2 is unique, its\nstability against noise has been proved only for highly more restrictive\ndecompositions satisfying ||s||_0 < (1+M^{-1})/2, because usually (1+M^{-1})/2\n<< spark(A)/2.\n  This limitation maybe had not been very important before, because ||s||_0 <\n(1+M^{-1})/2 is also the bound which guaranties that the sparse decomposition\ncan be found via minimizing the L1 norm, a classic approach for sparse\ndecomposition. However, with the availability of new algorithms for sparse\ndecomposition, namely SL0 and Robust-SL0, it would be important to know whether\nor not unique sparse decompositions with (1+M^{-1})/2 < ||s||_0 < spark(A)/2\nare stable. In this paper, we show that such decompositions are indeed stable.\nIn other words, we extend the stability bound from ||s||_0 < (1+M^{-1})/2 to\nthe whole uniqueness range ||s||_0 < spark(A)/2. In summary, we show that \"all\nunique sparse decompositions are stably recoverable\".

The\nGDMT of the MIMO Z-IC under the No-CSIT assumption is also obtained for some\nrange of multiplexing gains. The size of this range depends on the numbers of\nantennas at the four nodes and the SNR and INR exponents of the direct and\ncross links, respectively. For certain classes of channels including those in\nwhich the interfered receiver has more antennas than do the other nodes, or\nwhen the INR exponent is greater than a certain threshold, the GDMT of the MIMO\nZ-IC under the No-CSIT assumption is completely characterized.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Jun 2010 20:48:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 8 Jul 2010 17:09:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 5 Dec 2011 01:54:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 17 Jun 2012 21:00:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Karmakar", "Sanjay", ""], ["Varanasi", "Mahesh K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.0542", "submitter": "Chun-Hung Liu", "authors": "Chun-Hung Liu and Jeffrey G.

In this\nregard, it generalizes the notion of incoherence in the existing literature on\nmodel selection and introduces two fundamental measures of coherence---termed\nas the worst-case coherence and the average coherence---among the columns of a\ndesign matrix. It utilizes these two measures of coherence to provide an\nin-depth analysis of a simple, model-order agnostic one-step thresholding (OST)\nalgorithm for model selection and proves that OST is feasible for exact as well\nas partial model selection as long as the design matrix obeys an easily\nverifiable property. One of the key insights offered by the ensuing analysis in\nthis regard is that OST can successfully carry out model selection even when\nmethods based on convex optimization such as the lasso fail due to the rank\ndeficiency of the submatrices of the design matrix. In addition, the paper\nestablishes that if the design matrix has reasonably small worst-case and\naverage coherence then OST performs near-optimally when either (i) the energy\nof any nonzero entry of the signal is close to the average signal energy per\nnonzero entry or (ii) the signal-to-noise ratio in the measurement system is\nnot too high.

Since the achievability result is proven using\na noncoherent decoder whose complexity grows exponentially in the number of\nfading blocks $K$, a simpler decoder, based on $S+1$ pilots, is also proposed.\nIts $\\epsilon$-achievable rate is shown to have pre-log factor equal to\n$1-\\frac{S+1}{N}$ with the previously considered channel, while its achievable\nrate is shown to have pre-log factor $1-\\frac{S+1}{N}$ when the support of the\nblock-fading channel remains fixed over time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Jun 2010 13:23:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 17 Mar 2011 12:47:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 27 Jun 2011 23:19:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["Kannu", "Arun Pachai", ""], ["Schniter", "Philip", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.1565", "submitter": "Neri Merhav", "authors": "Neri Merhav", "title": "Information Theory and Statistical Physics - Lecture Notes", "comments": "176 pages, 26 figures.

The notion of\nrestricted isometry property (RIP) and an upper bound on the restricted\nisometry constant (RIC) are employed to establish sufficient conditions for the\nexact localization by MUSIC with or without the presence of noise. In the\nnoiseless case, the sufficient condition gives an upper bound on the numbers of\nrandom sampling and incident directions necessary for exact localization.

Specifically, two source\nprediction loops, one for each description, are embedded within a common noise\nshaping loop, whose parameters are explicitly found from the spectral-domain\ncharacterization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Jun 2010 11:00:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 28 Sep 2011 09:47:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 4 Aug 2016 12:46:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-05", "authors_parsed": [["Ostergaard", "Jan", ""], ["Kochman", "Yuval", ""], ["Zamir", "Ram", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.2004", "submitter": "Georg Bocherer", "authors": "Georg Bocherer and Rudolf Mathar", "title": "Throughput, Bit-Cost, Network State Information: Tradeoffs in\n  Cooperative CSMA Protocols", "comments": "Some typos in v1 were corrected, to be presented at ISWCS 2010 in\n  York, United Kingdom", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In wireless local area networks, spatially varying channel conditions result\nin a severe performance discrepancy between different nodes in the uplink,\ndepending on their position.

The\nassociated channel matrices are fixed and known to all the terminals. A\ncomputable characterization of the secrecy capacity is established as the\nsaddle point solution to a minimax problem. The converse is based on a\nSato-type argument used in other broadcast settings, and the coding theorem is\nbased on Gaussian wiretap codebooks.\n  At high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the secrecy capacity is shown to be\nattained by simultaneously diagonalizing the channel matrices via the\ngeneralized singular value decomposition, and independently coding across the\nresulting parallel channels. The associated capacity is expressed in terms of\nthe corresponding generalized singular values. It is shown that a semi-blind\n\"masked\" multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transmission strategy that sends\ninformation along directions in which there is gain to the intended receiver,\nand synthetic noise along directions in which there is not, can be arbitrarily\nfar from capacity in this regime.\n  Necessary and sufficient conditions for the secrecy capacity to be zero are\nprovided, which simplify in the limit of many antennas when the entries of the\nchannel matrices are independent and identically distributed. The resulting\nscaling laws establish that to prevent secure communication, the eavesdropper\nneeds 3 times as many antennas as the sender and intended receiver have\njointly, and that the optimimum division of antennas between sender and\nintended receiver is in the ratio of 2:1.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Jun 2010 15:10:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Khisti", "Ashish", ""], ["Wornell", "Gregory", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.5894", "submitter": "Anna Rimoldi", "authors": "Anna Rimoldi, Massimiliano Sala, Ilia Toli", "title": "A possible intrinsic weakness of AES and other cryptosystems", "comments": "46 pages- updated bibliography and fixed minor problems", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.CR math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It has been suggested that the algebraic structure of AES (and other similar\nblock ciphers) could lead to a weakness exploitable in new attacks.
