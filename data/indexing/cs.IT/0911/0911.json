The traditional view on how to enable CSIT has\nbeen as follows so far: In time-division duplexed (TDD) systems, uplink (UL)\nand downlink (DL) channel reciprocity allows the use of a training sequence in\nthe UL direction, which is exploited to obtain an UL channel estimate.

Yet at the same\ntime, the achievable sum-rate with single-cell processing (SCP) scales\noptimally with the number of users under Rayleigh fading conditions. One may\ntherefore ask if the value of BS coordination is limited in the many-user\nregime from a sum-rate perspective. With this in mind we consider multicell\nzero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) on the downlink of a linear cell-array. We\nfirst identify the beamforming weights and the optimal scheduling policy under\na per-base power constraint. We then compare the number of users m and n\nrequired per-cell to achieve the same mean SINR, after optimal scheduling, with\nSCP and ZFBF respectively. Specifically, we show that the ratio m/n grows\nlogarithmically with n. Finally, we demonstrate that the gain in sum-rate\nbetween ZFBF and SCP is significant for all practical values of number of\nusers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Nov 2009 20:29:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 6 Nov 2009 09:38:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-06", "authors_parsed": [["Bang", "H.

In this paper, for a\nmultiple-input-single-output (MISO) SU channel coexisting with a\nsingle-input-single-output (SISO) PU channel, we propose a new and practical\nparadigm for designing CB based on the finite-rate cooperative feedback from\nthe PU receiver to the SU transmitter. Specifically, the PU receiver\ncommunicates to the SU transmitter the quantized SU-to-PU channel direction\ninformation (CDI) for computing the SU transmit beamformer, and the\ninterference power control (IPC) signal that regulates the SU transmission\npower according to the tolerable interference margin at the PU receiver. Two CB\nalgorithms based on cooperative feedback are proposed: one restricts the SU\ntransmit beamformer to be orthogonal to the quantized SU-to-PU channel\ndirection and the other relaxes such a constraint. In addition, cooperative\nfeedforward of the SU CDI from the SU transmitter to the PU receiver is\nexploited to allow more efficient cooperative feedback. The outage\nprobabilities of the SU link for different CB and cooperative\nfeedback/feedforward algorithms are analyzed, from which the optimal\nbit-allocation tradeoff between the CDI and IPC feedback is characterized.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Nov 2009 05:09:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 15 Oct 2010 09:48:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-18", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Kaibin", ""], ["Zhang", "Rui", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.3213", "submitter": "Neri Merhav", "authors": "Neri Merhav", "title": "Optimum estimation via gradients of partition functions and information\n  measures: a statistical-mechanical perspective", "comments": "21 pages; submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TIT.2011.2132590", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In continuation to a recent work on the statistical--mechanical analysis of\nminimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation in Gaussian noise via its relation\nto the mutual information (the I-MMSE relation), here we propose a simple and\nmore direct relationship between optimum estimation and certain information\nmeasures (e.g., the information density and the Fisher information), which can\nbe viewed as partition functions and hence are amenable to analysis using\nstatistical--mechanical techniques.

In these models, since\nthe source node also receives signals, its encoder has the option of computing\nits output based on the signals it received in the past. On the other hand,\nfrom a practical point of view, it would also be desirable to identify the\ncases where such an encoder design may not improve communication rates. This\nquestion is particularly interesting for the case where the transmitted\nmessages and the feedback signals are subject to eavesdropping. In this work,\nwe investigate the question of how much impact the feedback has on the secrecy\ncapacity by studying two fundamental models. First, we consider the Gaussian\ntwo-way wiretap channel and derive an outer bound for its secrecy capacity\nregion. We show that the secrecy rate loss can be unbounded when feedback\nsignals are not utilized except for a special case we identify, and thus\nconclude that utilizing feedback can be highly beneficial in general. Second,\nwe consider a half-duplex Gaussian two-way relay channel where the relay node\nis also an eavesdropper, and find that the impact of feedback is less\npronounced compared to the previous scenario. Specifically, the loss in secrecy\nrate, when ignoring the feedback, is quantified to be less than 0.5 bit per\nchannel use when the relay power goes to infinity. This achievable rate region\nis obtained with simple time sharing along with cooperative jamming, which,\nwith its simplicity and near optimum performance, is a viable alternative to an\nencoder that utilizes feedback signals.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Nov 2009 15:54:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-24", "authors_parsed": [["He", "Xiang", ""], ["Yener", "Aylin", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.4507", "submitter": "Cenk M.

One of the main challenges in compressed\nsensing is to find the support of a sparse signal. In the literature, several\nbounds on the scaling law of the number of measurements for successful support\nrecovery have been derived where the main focus is on random Gaussian\nmeasurement matrices. In this paper, we investigate the noisy support recovery\nproblem from an estimation theoretic point of view, where no specific\nassumption is made on the underlying measurement matrix.

On the one hand, this choice allows us to\nuse the machinery behind the $\\ell_2$-norm error metric and on the other hand,\nconverts the support recovery into a more intuitive and geometrical problem.\nFirst, by using the Hammersley-Chapman-Robbins (HCR) bound, we derive a\nfundamental lower bound on the performance of any \\emph{unbiased} estimator of\nthe support set.

Signal to interference and\nnoise ratios (SINRs) for suboptimal receivers, such as the linear minimum mean\nsquare error (MMSE) detectors, are derived. The approach is general and\noptionally allows even for statistics obtained by under-sampling the received\nsignal.\n  All performance measures are given as a function of the chip waveform and the\ndelay distribution of the users in the large system limit. It turns out that\nsynchronizing users on a chip level impairs performance for all chip waveforms\nwith bandwidth greater than the Nyquist bandwidth, e.g., positive roll-off\nfactors. For example, with the pulse shaping demanded in the UMTS standard,\nuser synchronization reduces spectral efficiency up to 12% at 10 dB normalized\nsignal-to-noise ratio. The benefits of asynchronism stem from the finding that\nthe excess bandwidth of chip waveforms actually spans additional dimensions in\nsignal space, if the users are de-synchronized on the chip-level. The analysis\nof linear MMSE detectors shows that the limiting interference effects can be\ndecoupled both in the user domain and in the frequency domain such that the\nconcept of the effective interference spectral density arises. This generalizes\nand refines Tse and Hanly's concept of effective interference.\n  In Part II, the analysis is extended to any linear detector that admits a\nrepresentation as multistage detector and guidelines for the design of low\ncomplexity multistage detectors with universal weights are provided.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Nov 2009 09:11:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Cottatellucci", "Laura", ""], ["Mueller", "Ralf R.", ""], ["Debbah", "Merouane", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.5459", "submitter": "Graham Norton", "authors": "Graham H.
