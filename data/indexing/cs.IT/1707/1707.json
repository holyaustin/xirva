Recently, it has\nbeen shown that codes can provide significant gains in overcoming these\nbottlenecks. In particular, optimal coding schemes for minimizing latency in\ndistributed computation of linear functions and mitigating the effect of\nstragglers was proposed for a wired network, where the workers can\nsimultaneously transmit messages to a master node without interference. In this\npaper, we focus on the problem of coded computation over a wireless\nmaster-worker setup with straggling workers, where only one worker can transmit\nthe result of its local computation back to the master at a time. We consider 3\nasymptotic regimes (determined by how the communication and computation times\nare scaled with the number of workers) and precisely characterize the total\nrun-time of the distributed algorithm and optimum coding strategy in each\nregime. In particular, for the regime of practical interest where the\ncomputation and communication times of the distributed computing algorithm are\ncomparable, we show that the total run-time approaches a simple lower bound\nthat decouples computation and communication, and demonstrate that coded\nschemes are $\\Theta(\\log(n))$ times faster than uncoded schemes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Jun 2017 20:22:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Reisizadeh", "Amirhossein", ""], ["Pedarsani", "Ramtin", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.00052", "submitter": "Andreas Lenz", "authors": "Andreas Lenz, Antonia Wachter-Zeh, Eitan Yaakobi", "title": "Bounds on Codes Correcting Tandem and Palindromic Duplications", "comments": "Published at the 10th International Workshop on Coding and\n  Cryptography (WCC) 2017", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work, we derive upper bounds on the cardinality of tandem duplication\nand palindromic deletion correcting codes by deriving the generalized sphere\npacking bound for these error types.

We provide an\nalgebraic characterisation of this subspace which turns the optimization\nproblem into a purely algebraic one and more importantly, leads to several\ninteresting analytical proofs. We prove that with probability one, the\ndimension of the estimation subspace for the channel coefficients is\ndeterministic and it decreases by increasing the number of receive antennas up\nto a certain critical number of receive antennas, after which the dimension\nremains constant. In fact, we show that beyond this critical number of receive\nantennas, the estimation subspace for the channel coefficients is isometric to\na fixed deterministic invariant space which can be easily computed for every\nspecific OSTB code.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Jul 2017 16:37:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 8 Nov 2017 17:55:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 25 May 2020 14:35:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-26", "authors_parsed": [["Kalbasi", "Kamran", ""], ["Golestani", "S.

In total nine features per acceleration direction and\nlower body joint angle are calculated and extracted in real-time to achieve a\nfast feedback to the user. We compare the classification accuracy and\nquantification capabilities of Linear Discriminant Analysis, Principal\nComponent Analysis and Naive Bayes algorithms. The presented system is able to\nclassify patients and control subjects with an accuracy of up to 100\\%. The\noutcomes can be saved on the device or transmitted to treating physicians for\nlater control of the subject's improvements and the efficiency of physiotherapy\ntreatments in motor rehabilitation. The proposed autonomous quality metric\nsolution bears great potential to be used and deployed to support digital\nhealthcare and therapy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Jul 2017 11:54:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-12", "authors_parsed": [["Alcaraz", "Javier Conte", ""], ["Moghaddamnia", "Sanam", ""], ["Peissig", "J\u00fcrgen", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.03285", "submitter": "Rafael Villarreal H", "authors": "Manuel Gonzalez-Sarabia, Jose Mart\\'inez-Bernal, Rafael H.

To circumvent these difficulties,\nwe develop expressions for the predictive accuracy and thermodynamic costs of\nthe broad class of conditionally Markovian sensors subject to unifilar hidden\nsemi-Markov (memoryful) environmental inputs.

When energetic rewards are proportional to total predictable\ninformation, the closest cooperativity that optimizes the total energy budget\ngenerally depends on the environment's past hysteretically. In this way, the\nsensor gains robustness to environmental fluctuations. Given the simplicity of\nthe Hill molecule, such hysteresis will likely be found in more complex\npredictive sensors as well.

Effective capacity (EC) is used as the\nthroughput metric in the presence of such statistical delay constraints since\ndeterministic delay bounds are difficult to guarantee due to the time-varying\nnature of wireless fading channels. A communication scenario with multiple\npairs of users in which different users have different delay requirements is\naddressed. Following characterizations from the rate-distortion (R-D) theory, a\nlogarithmic model of the quality-rate relation is used for predicting the\nquality of the reconstructed video in terms of the peak signal-to-noise ratio\n(PSNR) at the receiver side. Since the optimization problem is not concave or\nconvex, the optimal bandwidth and power allocation policies that maximize the\nweighted sum video quality subject to total bandwidth, maximum transmission\npower level and minimum required quality constraints are derived by using\nmonotonic optimization (MO) theory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Jul 2017 21:40:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-27", "authors_parsed": [["Ye", "Chuang", ""], ["Gursoy", "M.

Application of the detection tests to\ncorrelator outputs of scalar and vector tracking loops shows that they may be\nused to exclude multipath contaminated satellites from the navigation solution.\nThese detection techniques can be extended to other Global Navigation Satellite\nSystems (GNSS) such as GLONASS, Galileo and Beidou.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Jul 2017 08:58:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Amani", "Elie", "", "LISSI, F'SATI"], ["Djouani", "Karim", "", "LISSI, F'SATI"], ["Kurien", "Anish", "", "F'SATI"], ["De Boer", "Jean-R\u00e9mi", "", "CNES"], ["Vigneau", "Willy", "", "CNES"], ["Ries", "Lionel", "", "CNES"]]}, {"id": "1707.09792", "submitter": "Vishnu Raj", "authors": "Vishnu Raj, Irene Dias, Thulasi Tholeti and Sheetal Kalyani", "title": "Spectrum Access In Cognitive Radio Using A Two Stage Reinforcement\n  Learning Approach", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/JSTSP.2018.2798920", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.LG cs.NI math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  With the advent of the 5th generation of wireless standards and an increasing\ndemand for higher throughput, methods to improve the spectral efficiency of\nwireless systems have become very important. In the context of cognitive radio,\na substantial increase in throughput is possible if the secondary user can make\nsmart decisions regarding which channel to sense and when or how often to\nsense. Here, we propose an algorithm to not only select a channel for data\ntransmission but also to predict how long the channel will remain unoccupied so\nthat the time spent on channel sensing can be minimized. Our algorithm learns\nin two stages - a reinforcement learning approach for channel selection and a\nBayesian approach to determine the optimal duration for which sensing can be\nskipped. Comparisons with other learning methods are provided through extensive\nsimulations. We show that the number of sensing is minimized with negligible\nincrease in primary interference; this implies that lesser energy is spent by\nthe secondary user in sensing and also higher throughput is achieved by saving\non sensing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Jul 2017 10:18:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Raj", "Vishnu", ""], ["Dias", "Irene", ""], ["Tholeti", "Thulasi", ""], ["Kalyani", "Sheetal", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.09796", "submitter": "F.

Given a collection of $n$ items and a few pairwise comparisons\nacross them, one wishes to identify the set of $K$ items that receive the\nhighest ranks. To tackle this problem, we adopt the logistic parametric model\n--- the Bradley-Terry-Luce model, where each item is assigned a latent\npreference score, and where the outcome of each pairwise comparison depends\nsolely on the relative scores of the two items involved. Recent works have made\nsignificant progress towards characterizing the performance (e.g. the mean\nsquare error for estimating the scores) of several classical methods, including\nthe spectral method and the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). However, where\nthey stand regarding top-$K$ ranking remains unsettled.\n  We demonstrate that under a natural random sampling model, the spectral\nmethod alone, or the regularized MLE alone, is minimax optimal in terms of the\nsample complexity --- the number of paired comparisons needed to ensure exact\ntop-$K$ identification, for the fixed dynamic range regime. This is\naccomplished via optimal control of the entrywise error of the score estimates.\nWe complement our theoretical studies by numerical experiments, confirming that\nboth methods yield low entrywise errors for estimating the underlying scores.\nOur theory is established via a novel leave-one-out trick, which proves\neffective for analyzing both iterative and non-iterative procedures. Along the\nway, we derive an elementary eigenvector perturbation bound for probability\ntransition matrices, which parallels the Davis-Kahan $\\sin\\Theta$ theorem for\nsymmetric matrices. This also allows us to close the gap between the $\\ell_2$\nerror upper bound for the spectral method and the minimax lower limit.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Jul 2017 17:33:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 28 Sep 2017 03:20:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 4 Jul 2018 16:35:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-13", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Yuxin", ""], ["Fan", "Jianqing", ""], ["Ma", "Cong", ""], ["Wang", "Kaizheng", ""]]}]
