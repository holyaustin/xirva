However, the use of very large antenna arrays at the base stations\n(BSs) brings new issues, such as the significantly increased hardware and\nsignal processing costs. In order to reap the enormous gain of massive MIMO and\nyet reduce its cost to an affordable level, this paper proposes a novel system\ndesign by integrating an electromagnetic (EM) lens with the large antenna\narray, termed the EM-lens enabled MIMO. The EM lens has the capability of\nfocusing the power of an incident wave to a small area of the antenna array,\nwhile the location of the focal area varies with the angle of arrival (AoA) of\nthe wave. Therefore, in practical scenarios where the arriving signals from\ngeographically separated users have different AoAs, the EM-lens enabled system\nprovides two new benefits, namely energy focusing and spatial interference\nrejection. By taking into account the effects of imperfect channel estimation\nvia pilot-assisted training, in this paper we analytically show that the\naverage received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in both the single-user and\nmultiuser uplink transmissions can be strictly improved by the EM-lens enabled\nsystem.

Among different types of WET techniques, the radio\nfrequency (RF) signal enabled far-field WET is most practically appealing to\npower energy constrained wireless networks in a broadcast manner. To overcome\nthe significant path loss over wireless channels, multi-antenna or\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques have been proposed to enhance\nthe transmission efficiency and distance for RF-based WET. However, in order to\nreap the large energy beamforming gain in MIMO WET, acquiring the channel state\ninformation (CSI) at the energy transmitter (ET) is an essential task. This\ntask is particularly challenging for WET systems, since existing channel\ntraining and feedback methods used for communication receivers may not be\nimplementable at the energy receiver (ER) due to its hardware limitation. To\ntackle this problem, in this paper we consider a multiuser MIMO system for WET,\nwhere a multiple-antenna ET broadcasts wireless energy to a group of\nmultiple-antenna ERs concurrently via transmit energy beamforming. By taking\ninto account the practical energy harvesting circuits at the ER, we propose a\nnew channel learning method that requires only one feedback bit from each ER to\nthe ET per feedback interval.

We characterize the optimal throughput-outage tradeoff in\nterms of tight scaling laws for various regimes of the system parameters, when\nboth the number of nodes and the number of files in the library grow to\ninfinity. Our analysis is based on Gupta and Kumar {\\em protocol model} for the\nunderlying D2D wireless network, widely used in the literature on capacity\nscaling laws of wireless networks without caching. Our results show that the\ncombination of D2D spectrum reuse and caching at the user nodes yields a\nper-user throughput independent of the number of users, for any fixed outage\nprobability in $(0,1)$. This implies that the D2D caching network is\n\"scalable\": even though the number of users increases, each user achieves\nconstant throughput. This behavior is very different from the classical Gupta\nand Kumar result on ad-hoc wireless networks, for which the per-user throughput\nvanishes as the number of users increases. Furthermore, we show that the user\nthroughput is directly proportional to the fraction of cached information over\nthe whole file library size. Therefore, we can conclude that D2D caching\nnetworks can turn \"memory\" into \"bandwidth\" (i.e., doubling the on-board cache\nmemory on the user devices yields a 100\\% increase of the user throughout).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Dec 2013 01:04:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 28 Jul 2015 18:56:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Ji", "Mingyue", ""], ["Caire", "Giuseppe", ""], ["Molisch", "Andreas F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.2681", "submitter": "Gokul Sridharan Mr.", "authors": "Gokul Sridharan and Wei Yu", "title": "Degrees of Freedom of MIMO Cellular Networks: Decomposition and Linear\n  Beamforming Design", "comments": "25 pages, 14 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information\n  Theory", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper investigates the symmetric degrees of freedom (DoF) of MIMO\ncellular networks with G cells and K users per cell, having N antennas at each\nbase station and M antennas at each user.

Examples of such\nsituations include point-to-point communication over inter-symbol interference\n(ISI) channels and asynchronous wireless networks. In these scenarios, although\nthe receiver may know all the delays, it is often not be an easy task for the\nreceiver to compensate the delays as the signals are mixed together.

Two\ninstances of asynchronous physical-layer network coding, namely the\ninteger-forcing equalization for ISI channels and asynchronous\ncompute-and-forward, are then studied. For integer-forcing equalization, the\nproposed scheme provides improved performance over using cyclic codes. For\nasynchronous compute-and-forward, the proposed scheme shows that there is no\nloss in the achievable information due to delays which are integer multiples of\nthe symbol duration. Further, the proposed approach shows that delays\nintroduced by the channel can sometimes be exploited to obtain higher\ninformation rates than those obtainable in the synchronous case.

Because\nthe interference received at each antenna originates from the same set of\ninterferers, but partially de-correlates over the fading channel, it possesses\na complex correlation structure. This work develops a realistic analytic model\nthat accurately accounts for the interference correlation using stochastic\ngeometry. Modeling interference by a Poisson shot noise process with\nindependent Nakagami fading, we derive the link success probability for\ndual-branch interference-aware MRC. Using this result, we show that the common\nassumption that all receive antennas experience equal interference power\nunderestimates the true performance, although this gap rapidly decays with\nincreasing the Nakagami parameter $m_{\\text{I}}$ of the interfering links. In\ncontrast, ignoring interference correlation leads to a highly optimistic\nperformance estimate for MRC, especially for large $m_{\\text{I}}$. In the low\noutage probability regime, our success probability expression can be\nconsiderably simplified.

Both proposed coding strategies assume hard-decision\ndecoding of the inner code with inner decoding failure generating erasure\nsymbols for the outer Raptor code. Raptor codes allow low-complexity decoding\nof very long codewords while providing capacity- approaching performance for\nerasure channels. For the off-line page recovery scheme, one whole NAND block\nforms a Raptor codeword with each inner codeword typically made up of several\nRaptor symbols. An efficient look-up-table strategy is devised for Raptor\nencoding and decoding which avoids using large buffers in the controller\ndespite the substantial size of the Raptor code employed. The potential\nperformance benefit of the proposed scheme is evaluated in terms of the\nprobability of block recovery conditioned on the presence of uncorrectable\npages.

OFDM\nsignaling can obviate the need for tight time synchronization among multiple\nsimultaneous transmissions in the uplink of PNC systems. However, OFDM PNC\nsystems are susceptible to phase drifts caused by residual carrier frequency\noffsets (CFOs). In the traditional OFDM system in which a receiver receives\nfrom only one transmitter, pilot tones are employed to aid phase tracking. In\nOFDM PNC systems, multiple transmitters transmit to a receiver, and these pilot\ntones must be shared among the multiple transmitters. This reduces the number\nof pilots that can be used by each transmitting node. Phase tracking in OFDM\nPNC is more challenging as a result. To overcome the degradation due to the\nreduced number of per-node pilots, this work supplements the pilots with the\nchannel information contained in the data. In particular, we propose to solve\nthe problems of phase tracking and channel decoding jointly.

By exploiting the second order statistical information\nof the received signals, co-prime arrays exhibit O(MN) degrees of freedom with\nonly M + N sensors. A sparsity based recovery method is proposed to fully\nutilize these degrees of freedom. Unlike traditional sparse recovery methods,\nthe proposed method is based on the developing theory of super resolution,\nwhich considers a continuous range of possible sources instead of discretizing\nthis range into a discrete grid. With this approach, off-grid effects inherited\nin traditional sparse recovery can be neglected, thus improving the accuracy of\nDOA estimation. In this paper we show that in the noiseless case one can\ntheoretically detect up to M N sources with only 2M + N sensors. The noise 2\nstatistics of co-prime arrays are also analyzed to demonstrate the robustness\nof the proposed optimization scheme. A source number detection method is\npresented based on the spectrum reconstructed from the sparse method.
