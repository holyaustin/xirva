In many cases, the signal sparsity\nand the recovery performance can be further improved by replacing the L1 norm\nwith a \"weighted\" L1 norm. Without any prior information about nonzero elements\nof the signal, the procedure for selecting weights is iterative in nature.\nCommon approaches update the weights at every iteration using the solution of a\nweighted L1 problem from the previous iteration.\n  In this paper, we present two homotopy-based algorithms that efficiently\nsolve reweighted L1 problems. First, we present an algorithm that quickly\nupdates the solution of a weighted L1 problem as the weights change. Since the\nsolution changes only slightly with small changes in the weights, we develop a\nhomotopy algorithm that replaces the old weights with the new ones in a small\nnumber of computationally inexpensive steps. Second, we propose an algorithm\nthat solves a weighted L1 problem by adaptively selecting the weights while\nestimating the signal. This algorithm integrates the reweighting into every\nstep along the homotopy path by changing the weights according to the changes\nin the solution and its support, allowing us to achieve a high quality signal\nreconstruction by solving a single homotopy problem. We compare the performance\nof both algorithms, in terms of reconstruction accuracy and computational\ncomplexity, against state-of-the-art solvers and show that our methods have\nsmaller computational cost.

The major drawback of\nminwise hashing is the expensive preprocessing cost, as the method requires\napplying (e.g.,) k=200 to 500 permutations on the data. The testing time can\nalso be expensive if a new data point (e.g., a new document or image) has not\nbeen processed, which might be a significant issue in user-facing applications.\n  We develop a very simple solution based on one permutation hashing.\nConceptually, given a massive binary data matrix, we permute the columns only\nonce and divide the permuted columns evenly into k bins; and we simply store,\nfor each data vector, the smallest nonzero location in each bin. The\ninteresting probability analysis (which is validated by experiments) reveals\nthat our one permutation scheme should perform very similarly to the original\n(k-permutation) minwise hashing. In fact, the one permutation scheme can be\neven slightly more accurate, due to the \"sample-without-replacement\" effect.\n  Our experiments with training linear SVM and logistic regression on the\nwebspam dataset demonstrate that this one permutation hashing scheme can\nachieve the same (or even slightly better) accuracies compared to the original\nk-permutation scheme. To test the robustness of our method, we also experiment\nwith the small news20 dataset which is very sparse and has merely on average\n500 nonzeros in each data vector. Interestingly, our one permutation scheme\nnoticeably outperforms the k-permutation scheme when k is not too small on the\nnews20 dataset. In summary, our method can achieve at least the same accuracy\nas the original k-permutation scheme, at merely 1/k of the original\npreprocessing cost.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Aug 2012 12:28:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-08", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Ping", ""], ["Owen", "Art", ""], ["Zhang", "Cun-Hui", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.1270", "submitter": "Laszlo Gyongyosi", "authors": "Laszlo Gyongyosi, Sandor Imre", "title": "Properties of the Quantum Channel", "comments": "Review paper: A tribute to the inventors of the various capacity\n  formulas of quantum channels. 304 pages, 5 tables, 106 figures; added new\n  section", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Quantum information processing exploits the quantum nature of information.

A single-hop\nbroadcasting system model is considered that aims to deliver a block of packets\nto all receivers in the presence of packet erasures. For a fair and\nanalytically tractable comparison between the two coding schemes, the\ntransmission comprises two phases: a systematic transmission phase and a\nnetwork coded transmission phase which is further divided into rounds. After\nthe systematic transmission phase and given the same packet reception state,\nthree quantitative metrics are proposed and derived in each scheme: 1) the\nabsolute minimum number of transmissions in the first coded transmission round\n(assuming no erasures), 2) probability distribution of extra coded\ntransmissions in a subsequent round (due to erasures), and 3) average packet\ndecoding delay. This comparative study enables application-aware adaptive\nselection between IDNC and RLNC after systematic transmission phase.\n  One contribution of this paper is to provide a deep and systematic\nunderstanding of the IDNC scheme, to propose the notion of packet diversity and\nan optimal IDNC encoding scheme for minimizing metric 1. This is generally\nNP-hard, but nevertheless required for characterizing and deriving all the\nthree metrics. Analytical and numerical results show that there is no clear\nwinner between RLNC and IDNC if one is concerned with both throughput and\ndecoding delay performance. IDNC is more preferable than RLNC when the number\nof receivers is smaller than packet block size, and the case reverses when the\nnumber of receivers is much greater than the packet block size.

In this paper, we\napply the AG method to various SLM schemes which are the conventional SLM\nscheme and its low-complexity versions such as Lim's, Wang's, and Baxely's SLM\nschemes. Of course, the AG method can be applied to most of existing SLM\nschemes easily. The numerical results show that the AG method can reduce their\ncomputational complexity substantially.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Aug 2012 07:58:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Kee-Hoon", ""], ["Joo", "Hyun-Seung", ""], ["No", "Jong-Seon", ""], ["Shin", "Dong-Joon", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.6464", "submitter": "Zai Yang", "authors": "Zai Yang, Lihua Xie, and Cishen Zhang", "title": "Bayesian compressed sensing with new sparsity-inducing prior", "comments": "11 pages, 6 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) is a popular approach to sparse signal\nrecovery in compressed sensing (CS). In SBL, the signal sparsity information is\nexploited by assuming a sparsity-inducing prior for the signal that is then\nestimated using Bayesian inference. In this paper, a new sparsity-inducing\nprior is introduced and efficient algorithms are developed for signal recovery.\nThe main algorithm is shown to produce a sparser solution than existing SBL\nmethods while preserving their desirable properties. Numerical simulations with\none-dimensional synthetic signals and two-dimensional images verify our\nanalysis and show that for sparse signals the proposed algorithm outperforms\nits SBL peers in both the signal recovery accuracy and computational speed. Its\nimproved performance is also demonstrated in comparison with other\nstate-of-the-art methods in CS.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Aug 2012 11:32:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Zai", ""], ["Xie", "Lihua", ""], ["Zhang", "Cishen", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.6493", "submitter": "Amol Sasane", "authors": "Amol Sasane", "title": "Shannon's sampling theorem in a distributional setting", "comments": "This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to an error in a\n  claim about singular supports in the proof", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.FA cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The classical Shannon sampling theorem states that a signal f with Fourier\ntransform F in L^2(R) having its support contained in (-\\pi,\\pi) can be\nrecovered from the sequence of samples (f(n))_{n in Z} via f(t)=\\sum_{n in Z}\nf(n) (sin(\\pi (t -n)))/(\\pi (t-n)) (t in R).
