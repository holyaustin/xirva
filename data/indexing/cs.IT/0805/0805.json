The main idea is to decode the sum of the codewords modulo a\nlattice at the relay followed by a broadcast phase which performs Slepian-Wolf\ncoding with structured codes. For asymptotically low SNR's, jointly decoding\nthe two transmissions at the relay (MAC channel) is shown to be optimal.

The\nmismatched decoding model is well-defined for finite, yet arbitrary, block\nlengths, and naturally captures the channel memory among the bits belonging to\nthe same symbol. We give two independent proofs of the achievability of the\nBICM capacity calculated by Caire et al. where BICM was modeled as a set of\nindependent parallel binary-input channels whose output is the bitwise\nlog-likelihood ratio. Our first achievability proof uses typical sequences, and\nshows that due to the random coding construction, the interleaver is not\nrequired. The second proof is based on the random coding error exponents with\nmismatched decoding, where the largest achievable rate is the generalized\nmutual information. We show that the generalized mutual information of the\nmismatched decoder coincides with the infinite-interleaver BICM capacity. We\nalso show that the error exponent -and hence the cutoff rate- of the BICM\nmismatched decoder is upper bounded by that of coded modulation and may thus be\nlower than in the infinite-interleaved model. We also consider the mutual\ninformation appearing in the analysis of iterative decoding of BICM with EXIT\ncharts. We show that the corresponding symbol metric has knowledge of the\ntransmitted symbol and the EXIT mutual information admits a representation as a\npseudo-generalized mutual information, which is in general not achievable. A\ndifferent symbol decoding metric, for which the extrinsic side information\nrefers to the hypothesized symbol, induces a generalized mutual information\nlower than the coded modulation capacity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 May 2008 11:06:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-05-12", "authors_parsed": [["Martinez", "Alfonso", ""], ["Fabregas", "Albert Guillen i", ""], ["Caire", "Giuseppe", ""], ["Willems", "Frans", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.1340", "submitter": "Onur Ozan Koyluoglu", "authors": "Onur Ozan Koyluoglu, Hesham El Gamal, Lifeng Lai, H.

A PIC group decoding decodes the symbols embedded in\nan STBC by dividing them into several groups and decoding each group separately\nafter a linear PIC operation is implemented. It can be viewed as an\nintermediate decoding between the maximum likelihood (ML) receiver that decodes\nall the embedded symbols together, i.e., all the embedded symbols are in a\nsingle group, and the zero-forcing (ZF) receiver that decodes all the embedded\nsymbols separately and independently, i.e., each group has and only has one\nembedded symbol, after the ZF operation is implemented. Our proposed design\ncriterion for the PIC group decoding to achieve full diversity is an\nintermediate condition between the loosest ML full rank criterion of codewords\nand the strongest ZF linear independence condition of the column vectors in the\nequivalent channel matrix. We also propose asymptotically optimal (AO) group\ndecoding algorithm, which is an intermediate decoding between the MMSE decoding\nalgorithm and the ML decoding algorithm. The design criterion for the PIC group\ndecoding applies to the AO group decoding algorithm. It is well-known that the\nsymbol rate for a full rank linear STBC can be full, i.e., n_t for n_t transmit\nantennas. It has been recently shown that its rate is upper bounded by 1 if a\ncode achieves full diversity with a linear receiver. The intermediate criterion\nproposed in this paper provides the possibility for codes of rates between n_t\nand 1 that achieve full diversity with a PIC group decoding.

In mismatched channels, where the\nabove conditions are not met, it is shown that the loss in performance with\nsemiunitary precoding when compared with a perfect channel information\nbenchmark is substantial. This loss needs to be mitigated via limited feedback\ntechniques that provide partial channel information to the transmitter. More\nimportantly, we develop matching metrics that capture the degree of matching of\na channel to the precoder structure continuously, and allow ordering two matrix\nchannels in terms of their mutual information or error probability performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 May 2008 20:17:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Raghavan", "Vasanthan", ""], ["Sayeed", "Akbar", ""], ["Veeravalli", "Venu", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.4440", "submitter": "Shervan Fashandi", "authors": "Shervan Fashandi, Shahab Oveis Gharan and Amir K.

We prove that if the number m of\nsampled entries obeys m >= C n^{1.2} r log n for some positive numerical\nconstant C, then with very high probability, most n by n matrices of rank r can\nbe perfectly recovered by solving a simple convex optimization program.

The cellular network is abstracted by symmetric models, which\nrender analytical treatment plausible. For this idealistic model family,\nachievable rates are presented for cell-sites that use compress-and-forward\nschemes combined with local decoding, for both Gaussian and fading channels.\nThe rates are given in closed form for the classical Wyner model and the\nsoft-handover model.
