Our goal is to design practical scheduling\npolicies that can achieve provably good performance in terms of both throughput\nand delay, at a low complexity. While a class of $O(n^{2.5} \\log n)$-complexity\nhybrid scheduling policies are recently developed to guarantee both\nrate-function delay optimality (in the many-channel many-user asymptotic\nregime) and throughput optimality (in the general non-asymptotic setting),\ntheir practical complexity is typically high. To address this issue, we develop\na simple greedy policy called Delay-based Server-Side-Greedy (D-SSG) with a\n\\lower complexity $2n^2+2n$, and rigorously prove that D-SSG not only achieves\nthroughput optimality, but also guarantees near-optimal asymptotic delay\nperformance. Specifically, we show that the rate-function attained by D-SSG for\nany delay-violation threshold $b$, is no smaller than the maximum achievable\nrate-function by any scheduling policy for threshold $b-1$. Thus, we are able\nto achieve a reduction in complexity (from $O(n^{2.5} \\log n)$ of the hybrid\npolicies to $2n^2 + 2n$) with a minimal drop in the delay performance. More\nimportantly, in practice, D-SSG generally has a substantially lower complexity\nthan the hybrid policies that typically have a large constant factor hidden in\nthe $O(\\cdot)$ notation. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to validate\nour theoretical results in various scenarios. The simulation results show that\nD-SSG not only guarantees a near-optimal rate-function, but also empirically is\nvirtually indistinguishable from delay-optimal policies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Dec 2012 16:05:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 24 Mar 2013 21:53:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 19 Nov 2013 09:19:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 23 Mar 2014 17:06:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-25", "authors_parsed": [["Ji", "Bo", ""], ["Gupta", "Gagan R.", ""], ["Sharma", "Manu", ""], ["Lin", "Xiaojun", ""], ["Shroff", "Ness B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.1703", "submitter": "Christian Hofbauer", "authors": "Mario Huemer, Christian Hofbauer, Johannes B.

Examples include recovering\nsparse or group-sparse vectors, low-rank matrices, and the sum of sparse and\nlow-rank matrices, among others. In various applications in signal processing\nand machine learning, the model of interest is known to be structured in\nseveral ways at the same time, for example, a matrix that is simultaneously\nsparse and low-rank.\n  Often norms that promote each individual structure are known, and allow for\nrecovery using an order-wise optimal number of measurements (e.g., $\\ell_1$\nnorm for sparsity, nuclear norm for matrix rank). Hence, it is reasonable to\nminimize a combination of such norms. We show that, surprisingly, if we use\nmulti-objective optimization with these norms, then we can do no better,\norder-wise, than an algorithm that exploits only one of the present structures.\nThis result suggests that to fully exploit the multiple structures, we need an\nentirely new convex relaxation, i.e. not one that is a function of the convex\nrelaxations used for each structure. We then specialize our results to the case\nof sparse and low-rank matrices. We show that a nonconvex formulation of the\nproblem can recover the model from very few measurements, which is on the order\nof the degrees of freedom of the matrix, whereas the convex problem obtained\nfrom a combination of the $\\ell_1$ and nuclear norms requires many more\nmeasurements.

Therefore, we extend the study of action-dependent channels, which\nuntil now focused on point-to-point models, to multiple-access channels (MAC).\nIn this paper, we consider a two-user, state-dependent MAC, in which one of the\nencoders, called the informed encoder, is allowed to take an action that\naffects the formation of the channel states. Two independent messages are to be\nsent through the channel: a common message known to both encoders and a private\nmessage known only to the informed encoder. In addition, the informed encoder\nhas access to the sequence of channel states in a non-causal manner. Our\nframework generalizes previously evaluated settings of state dependent\npoint-to-point channels with actions and MACs with common messages. We derive a\nsingle letter characterization of the capacity region for this setting. Using\nthis general result, we obtain and compute the capacity region for the Gaussian\naction-dependent MAC. The unique methods used in solving the Gaussian case are\nthen applied to obtain the capacity of the Gaussian action-dependent\npoint-to-point channel; a problem was left open until this work. Finally, we\nestablish some dualities between action-dependent channel coding and source\ncoding problems. Specifically, we obtain a duality between the considered MAC\nsetting and the rate distortion model known as \"Successive Refinement with\nActions\".

Many approaches have been proposed to lower\nthe error floor by designing new LDPC codes with fewer such substructures or by\nmodifying the decoding algorithm. Using a theoretical analysis of iterative MP\ndecoding in an idealized trapping set scenario, we show that a contributor to\nthe error floors observed in the literature may be the imprecise implementation\nof decoding algorithms and, in particular, the message quantization rules used.\nWe then propose a new quantization method -- (q+1)-bit quasi-uniform\nquantization -- that efficiently increases the dynamic range of messages,\nthereby overcoming a limitation of conventional quantization schemes. Finally,\nwe use the quasi-uniform quantizer to decode several LDPC codes that suffer\nfrom high error floors with traditional fixed-point decoder implementations.\nThe performance simulation results provide evidence that the proposed\nquantization scheme can, for a wide variety of codes, significantly lower error\nfloors with minimal increase in decoder complexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Dec 2012 05:18:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 9 Sep 2013 22:35:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-11", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Xiaojie", ""], ["Siegel", "Paul H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.6478", "submitter": "Gabriel Peyre", "authors": "Samuel Vaiter (CEREMADE), Charles Deledalle (CEREMADE), Gabriel\n  Peyr\\'e (CEREMADE), Jalal Fadili (GREYC), Charles Dossal (IMB)", "title": "The degrees of freedom of the Group Lasso for a General Design", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we are concerned with regression problems where covariates can\nbe grouped in nonoverlapping blocks, and where only a few of them are assumed\nto be active.
