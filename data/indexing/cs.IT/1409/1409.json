In social networks, social reciprocity\naccounts for retaliations in gang interactions, proxy wars in nation-state\nconflicts, or Internet memes shared via social media. Neuron spikes stimulate\nor inhibit spike activity in other neurons. Stock market shocks can trigger a\ncontagion of volatility throughout a financial network. In these and other\nexamples, only individual events associated with network nodes are observed,\nusually without knowledge of the underlying dynamic relationships between\nnodes.

Here, I advocate\nstudying the probability of spontaneous molecular self-replication as a\nfunction of the information contained in the replicator, and the environmental\nconditions that might enable this emergence. I show that (under certain\nsimplifying assumptions) the probability to discover a self-replicator by\nchance depends exponentially on the rate of formation of the monomers. If the\nrate at which monomers are formed is somewhat similar to the rate at which they\nwould occur in a self-replicating polymer, the likelihood to discover such a\nreplicator by chance is increased by many orders of magnitude.

Then, one approach to identify the non-locality of nature\nis to characterize closed sets of non-local correlations.

In the first, a centralized\nsystem with full channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT) is\nassumed, and the communication parameters like transmit power and data-rate are\njointly chosen for every fading vector realization. On the other hand, in\nfast-fading links with distributed CSIT, the lack of full CSI is compensated by\nperforming ergodic averaging over sufficiently many channel realizations.\nNotice that the distributed CSI may necessitate decentralized power-control for\noptimal data-transfer. Apart from these two models, the case of slow-fading\nlinks and distributed CSIT, though relevant to many systems, has received much\nless attention.\n  In this paper, a block-fading AWGN MAC with full CSI at the receiver and\ndistributed CSI at the transmitters is considered. The links undergo\nindependent fading, but otherwise have arbitrary fading distributions. The\nchannel statistics and respective long-term average transmit powers are known\nto all parties. We first consider the case where each encoder has knowledge\nonly of its own link quality, and not of others.

The key step in\nour solution is an optimal rate allocation function for any given set of\ndistributed power control laws at the transmitters.

The optimal solution of the joint\noptimization problem is derived using a graph theory approach by introducing\nthe cooperation graph and reformulating the problem as a maximum weight clique\nproblem in which the weight of each vertex is the contribution of the device\nidentified by the vertex. Through extensive simulations, the decoding delay\nexperienced by all devices in the Point to Multi-Point (PMP) configuration, the\nfully connected D2D (FC-D2D) configuration and the more practical partially\nconnected D2D (PC-D2D) configuration are compared. Numerical results suggest\nthat the PC-D2D outperforms the FC-D2D and provides appreciable gain especially\nfor poorly connected networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Sep 2014 10:13:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 21 May 2015 13:38:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-22", "authors_parsed": [["Douik", "Ahmed", ""], ["Sorour", "Sameh", ""], ["Al-Naffouri", "Tareq Y.", ""], ["Yang", "Hong-Chuan", ""], ["Alouini", "Mohamed-Slim", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.8580", "submitter": "Udo Schilcher", "authors": "Udo Schilcher, Stavros Toumpis, Martin Haenggi, Alessandro Crismani,\n  G\\\"unther Brandner, Christian Bettstetter", "title": "Interference Functionals in Poisson Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 62, no. 1, pp.\n  370-383, Jan. 2016", "doi": "10.1109/TIT.2015.2501799", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose and prove a theorem that allows the calculation of a class of\nfunctionals on Poisson point processes that have the form of expected values of\nsum-products of functions.

For some special cases, e.g., for relay channels where\nthe optimal PDF strategy reduces to DF or P2P transmission, it could be deduced\nthat Gaussian inputs maximize the PDF rate. For the general case, however, the\nproblem has remained open until now. In this work, we solve this problem by\nproving that the maximum achievable PDF rate for the Gaussian MIMO relay\nchannel is always attained by Gaussian channel inputs. Our proof relies on the\nchannel enhancement technique, which was originally introduced by Weingarten et\nal. to derive the (private message) capacity region of the Gaussian MIMO\nbroadcast channel. By combining this technique with a primal decomposition\napproach, we first establish that jointly Gaussian source and relay inputs\nmaximize the achievable PDF rate for the aligned Gaussian MIMO relay channel.\nSubsequently, we use a limiting argument to extend this result from the aligned\nto the general Gaussian MIMO relay channel.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Sep 2014 16:46:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Gerdes", "Lennart", ""], ["Hellings", "Christoph", ""], ["Weiland", "Lorenz", ""], ["Utschick", "Wolfgang", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.8642", "submitter": "Gabriel Arrobo", "authors": "Chao He, Yang Liu, Thomas P.

The novel reinforcement learning approaches and the MDP solution are\nexamined in an illustrative example for scalable video transmission. Our\nmethods offer large performance gains over competing methods that deliver the\ndata blocks sequentially.
