Previous work has focused on the use of separating systems for complete\ngraphs for this task. We prove that any deterministic adaptive algorithm needs\nto be a separating system in order to learn complete graphs in the worst case.\nIn addition, we present a novel separating system construction, whose size is\nclose to optimal and is arguably simpler than previous work in combinatorics.\nWe also develop a novel information theoretic lower bound on the number of\ninterventions that applies in full generality, including for randomized\nadaptive learning algorithms.\n  For general chordal graphs, we derive worst case lower bounds on the number\nof interventions. Building on observations about induced trees, we give a new\ndeterministic adaptive algorithm to learn directions on any chordal skeleton\ncompletely. In the worst case, our achievable scheme is an\n$\\alpha$-approximation algorithm where $\\alpha$ is the independence number of\nthe graph.

A new frame structure for OFDM,\nconsisting of a known preamble, cyclic prefix, data and known postamble is\nproposed, which has a higher throughput compared to the earlier work. A robust\nturbo decoder is proposed, which functions effectively over a wide range of\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The key contribution to the good performance of\nthe practical coherent receiver is due to the use of a long preamble (512 QPSK\nsymbols), which is perhaps not specified in any of the current wireless\ncommunication standards. We have also shown from computer simulations that, it\nis possible to obtain even better BER performance, using a better code. A\nsimple and approximate Cramer-Rao bound on the variance of the frequency offset\nestimation error for coherent detection, is derived. The proposed algorithms\nare well suited for implementation on a DSP-platform.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Nov 2015 04:30:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Vasudevan", "K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.00781", "submitter": "Saif Khan Mohammed Dr.", "authors": "Amit Agarwal, Sudarshan Mukherjee and Saif Khan Mohammed", "title": "Impact of Underlaid Multi-antenna D2D on Cellular Downlink in Massive\n  MIMO Systems", "comments": "Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we consider a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)\ndownlink system underlaid with a network of multi-antenna D2D user equipments\n(UEs).

Using mmWave for vehicular communications, however, is\noften viewed with some skepticism due to a misconception that the Doppler\nspread would become too large at these high frequencies. This is not true when\ndirectional beam is employed for communications. In this paper, closed form\nexpressions relating the channel coherence time and beamwidth are derived.\nUnlike prior work that assumed perfect beam pointing, the pointing error due to\nthe receiver motion is incorporated to show that there exists a non-zero\noptimal beamwidth that maximizes the coherence time. To investigate the\nmobility effect on the beam alignment which is an important feature in mmWave\nsystems, a novel concept of beam coherence time is defined. The beam coherence\ntime, which is an effective measure of beam alignment frequency, is shown to be\nmuch larger than the conventional channel coherence time and thus results in\nreduced beam alignment overhead. Using the derived correlation function, the\nchannel coherence time, and the beam coherence time, an overall performance\nmetric considering both the channel time-variation and the beam alignment\noverhead is derived. Using this metric, it is shown that beam alignment in\nevery beam coherence time performs better than the beam alignment in every\nchannel coherence time due to the large overhead for the latter case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Nov 2015 23:57:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-11", "authors_parsed": [["Va", "Vutha", ""], ["Choi", "Junil", ""], ["Heath", "Robert W.", "Jr"]]}, {"id": "1511.02989", "submitter": "Mohammad Mansour", "authors": "Hady Zeineddine and Mohammad M.

We show that in the asymptotic setting where\n$\\gamma=\\exp(nE)$, a (nonnegative) randomness rate above $\\inf_{Q_{\\sf U}:\nD(Q_{\\sf X}\\|{{\\pi}}_{\\sf X})\\le E} \\{D(Q_{\\sf X}\\|{{\\pi}}_{\\sf X})+I(Q_{\\sf\nU},Q_{\\sf X|U})-E\\}$ is sufficient to approximate the output distribution\n${{\\pi}}_{\\sf X}^{\\otimes n}$ using the channel $Q_{\\sf X|U}^{\\otimes n}$,\nwhere $Q_{\\sf U}\\to Q_{\\sf X|U}\\to Q_{\\sf X}$, and is also necessary in the\ncase of finite $\\mathcal{U}$ and $\\mathcal{X}$. In particular, a randomness\nrate of $\\inf_{Q_{\\sf U}}I(Q_{\\sf U},Q_{\\sf X|U})-E$ is always sufficient. We\nalso study the convergence of the approximation error under the high\nprobability criteria in the case of random codebooks. Moreover, by developing\nsimple bounds relating $E_{\\gamma}$ and other distance measures, we are able to\ndetermine the exact linear growth rate of the approximation errors measured in\nrelative entropy and smooth R\\'{e}nyi divergences for a fixed-input randomness\nrate. The new resolvability result is then used to derive 1) a one-shot upper\nbound on the probability of excess distortion in lossy compression, which is\nexponentially tight in the i.i.d.~setting, 2) a one-shot version of the mutual\ncovering lemma, and 3) a lower bound on the size of the eavesdropper list to\ninclude the actual message and a lower bound on the eavesdropper false-alarm\nprobability in the wiretap channel problem, which is (asymptotically)\nensemble-tight.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Nov 2015 19:01:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 21 Jul 2017 02:44:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-24", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Jingbo", ""], ["Cuff", "Paul", ""], ["Verd\u00fa", "Sergio", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.07903", "submitter": "Ahmad AlAmmouri", "authors": "Ahmad AlAmmouri, Hesham ElSawy, Mohamed-Slim Alouini", "title": "Flexible Design for $\\alpha$-Duplex Communications in Multi-Tier\n  Cellular Networks", "comments": "Submitted to Tcom", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Backward compatibility is an essential ingredient for the success of new\ntechnologies.

Finally, we study skew cyclic codes which are linear\nover the base field, proving that these codes include all Hamming-metric cyclic\ncodes, giving then a new relation between these codes and rank-metric skew\ncyclic codes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Nov 2015 14:41:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 22 Jul 2016 16:16:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-25", "authors_parsed": [["Mart\u00ednez-Pe\u00f1as", "Umberto", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.09413", "submitter": "Yansha Deng", "authors": "Yansha Deng, Adam Noel, Maged Elkashlan, Arumugam Nallanathan, and\n  Karen C.

In the Euclidean setting,\none fundamental technique for dimension reduction is to apply a random linear\nmap to the data. This dimension reduction procedure succeeds when it preserves\ncertain geometric features of the set.\n  The question is how large the embedding dimension must be to ensure that\nrandomized dimension reduction succeeds with high probability.\n  This paper studies a natural family of randomized dimension reduction maps\nand a large class of data sets. It proves that there is a phase transition in\nthe success probability of the dimension reduction map as the embedding\ndimension increases. For a given data set, the location of the phase transition\nis the same for all maps in this family. Furthermore, each map has the same\nstability properties, as quantified through the restricted minimum singular\nvalue. These results can be viewed as new universality laws in high-dimensional\nstochastic geometry.\n  Universality laws for randomized dimension reduction have many applications\nin applied mathematics, signal processing, and statistics. They yield design\nprinciples for numerical linear algebra algorithms, for compressed sensing\nmeasurement ensembles, and for random linear codes. Furthermore, these results\nhave implications for the performance of statistical estimation methods under a\nlarge class of random experimental designs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Nov 2015 19:14:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 7 Sep 2017 18:22:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 17 Sep 2017 00:45:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-19", "authors_parsed": [["Oymak", "Samet", ""], ["Tropp", "Joel A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.09440", "submitter": "Chong Li", "authors": "Chong Li and Nicola Elia", "title": "Control approach to computing the feedback capacity for stationary\n  finite dimensional Gaussian channels", "comments": "to appear in 2015 Allerton", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We firstly extend the interpretation of feedback communication over\nstationary finite dimensional Gaussian channels as feedback control systems by\nshowing that, the problem of finding stabilizing feedback controllers with\nmaximal reliable transmission rate over Youla parameters coincides with the\nproblem of finding strictly causal filters to achieve feedback capacity\nrecently derived in [1]. The aforementioned interpretation provides an approach\nto construct deterministic feedback coding schemes (with double exponential\ndecaying error probability). We next propose an asymptotic capacity-achieving\nupper bounds, which can be numerically evaluated by solving finite dimensional\ndual optimizations. From the filters that achieve upper bounds, we derive\nfeasible filters which lead to a sequence of lower bounds.
