It is thus a rather attractive\nassumption to base statistical analysis on, especially for problems for which\nless general qualitative assumptions, such as independence or finite memory,\nclearly fail. However, it has long been considered too general to allow for\nstatistical inference to be made. One of the reasons for this is that rates of\nconvergence, even of frequencies to the mean, are not available under this\nassumption alone. Recently, it has been shown that, while some natural and\nsimple problems such as homogeneity, are indeed provably impossible to solve if\none only assumes that the data is stationary (or stationary ergodic), many\nothers can be solved using rather simple and intuitive algorithms. The latter\nproblems include clustering and change point estimation. In this volume I\nsummarize these results. The emphasis is on asymptotic consistency, since this\nthe strongest property one can obtain assuming stationarity alone. While for\nmost of the problems for which a solution is found this solution is\nalgorithmically realizable, the main objective in this area of research, the\nobjective which is only partially attained, is to understand what is possible\nand what is not possible to do for stationary time series. The considered\nproblems include homogeneity testing, clustering with respect to distribution,\nclustering with respect to independence, change-point estimation, identity\ntesting, and the general question of composite hypotheses testing. For the\nlatter problem, a topological criterion for the existence of a consistent test\nis presented.

A system model involving a\ntransmitter (e.g., a base station) that sends VBR video data to a receiver\n(e.g., a mobile user) equipped with a playout buffer is adopted, as used in\ndynamic adaptive streaming video applications. In this setting, we analyze\npower control policies considering the following two objectives: 1) the\nminimization of the transmit power consumption, and 2) the minimization of the\ntransmission completion time of the communication session.

In this paper, we propose the BaSE (batched successive\nelimination) policy to achieve the rate-optimal regrets (within logarithmic\nfactors) for batched multi-armed bandits, with matching lower bounds even if\nthe batch sizes are determined in an adaptive manner.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Apr 2019 04:31:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 12 Sep 2019 03:08:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 26 Oct 2019 21:28:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-29", "authors_parsed": [["Gao", "Zijun", ""], ["Han", "Yanjun", ""], ["Ren", "Zhimei", ""], ["Zhou", "Zhengqing", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.01818", "submitter": "Kyung-Su Kim", "authors": "Kyung-Su Kim, Sae-Young Chung", "title": "Bayesian Approach with Extended Support Estimation for Sparse Regression", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A greedy algorithm called Bayesian multiple matching pursuit (BMMP) is\nproposed to estimate a sparse signal vector and its support given $m$ linear\nmeasurements.

We observe that the number of these bits is typically either\nzero or a small number, and provide an improved analysis, compared to that\npresented in the literature, on the size of this set and on its scaling with\nrespect to the blocklength when the power constraint parameter is sufficiently\nlarge or the channel crossover probability sufficiently small.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Apr 2019 10:10:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["Beilin", "Barak", ""], ["Burshtein", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.02572", "submitter": "Vijaya Yajnanarayana Ph.D", "authors": "Vijaya Yajnanarayana, Henrik Ryd\\'en, L\\'aszl\\'o H\\'evizi", "title": "5G Handover using Reinforcement Learning", "comments": "6 Pages, Accepted for publication in IEEE 5G World Forum (5GWF) 2020\n  Conference", "journal-ref": "2020 IEEE 3rd 5G World Forum (5GWF), Bangalore, India, 2020, pp.\n  349-354,", "doi": "10.1109/5GWF49715.2020.9221072", "report-no": "10.1109/5GWF49715.2020.9221072", "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In typical wireless cellular systems, the handover mechanism involves\nreassigning an ongoing session handled by one cell into another.

In this paper, we propose a virtual\nwaveform design for an adaptive mmWave JCR. The proposed system transmits a few\nnon-uniformly placed preambles to construct several receive virtual preambles\nfor enhancing velocity estimation accuracy, at the cost of only a small\nreduction in the communication data rate. We evaluate JCR performance\ntrade-offs using the Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) metric for radar estimation and a\nnovel distortion minimum mean square error (MMSE) metric for data\ncommunication. Additionally, we develop three different MMSE-based optimization\nproblems for the adaptive JCR waveform design. Simulations show that an optimal\nvirtual (non-uniform) waveform achieves a significant performance improvement\nas compared to a uniform waveform. For a radar CRB constrained optimization,\nthe optimal radar range of operation and the optimal communication distortion\nMMSE (DMMSE) are improved. For a communication DMMSE constrained optimization\nwith a high DMMSE constraint, the optimal radar CRB is enhanced. For a weighted\nMMSE average optimization, the advantage of the virtual waveform over the\nuniform waveform is increased with decreased communication weighting.\nComparison of MMSE-based optimization with traditional virtual preamble\ncount-based optimization indicated that the conventional solution converges to\nthe MMSE-based one only for a small number of targets and a high\nsignal-to-noise ratio.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Apr 2019 03:37:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-19", "authors_parsed": [["Kumari", "Preeti", ""], ["Vorobyov", "Sergiy A.", ""], ["Heath", "Robert W.", "Jr"]]}, {"id": "1904.05587", "submitter": "F.

Next, in the case of unknown file popularity\ndistribution, we formulate the stochastic optimization problem to maximize the\nstochastic STP (i.e., the STP in the stochastic form), which is a challenging\nnonconvex stochastic optimization problem. Based on stochastic parallel SCA, we\ndevelop an efficient iterative algorithm to obtain a stationary point, by\nexploiting structural properties of the stochastic STP and making full use of\ninstantaneous file requests. As far as we know, this is the first work\nconsidering stochastic optimization in a large-scale multi-tier wireless\nnetwork.

Then, we reformulate the hit ratio maximization problems into\na submodular function maximization and propose two computationally efficient\nalgorithms including a greedy approach to efficiently solve the cache\nallocation problems. We analyze the computational complexity of each algorithm.\nMoreover, we analyze the corresponding level of the approximation that our\ngreedy algorithm can achieve compared to the optimal solution. Using a\nreal-world dataset, we demonstrate that the proposed framework employing the\npersonalized file preferences brings substantial gains over its counterpart for\nvarious system parameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Apr 2019 05:54:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 19 Feb 2020 16:22:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 20 Feb 2020 05:43:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-21", "authors_parsed": [["Malik", "Adeel", ""], ["Kim", "Joongheon", ""], ["Kim", "Kwang Soon", ""], ["Shin", "Won-Yong", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.06761", "submitter": "Peihao Dong", "authors": "Peihao Dong, Hua Zhang, Geoffrey Ye Li, Ivan Simoes Gaspar, Navid\n  NaderiAlizadeh", "title": "Deep CNN-Based Channel Estimation for mmWave Massive MIMO Systems", "comments": "The executable codes associated with this paper are available at\n  https://github.com/phdong21/CNN4CE.git", "journal-ref": "in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing, vol. 13,\n  no. 5, pp. 989-1000, Sept. 2019", "doi": "10.1109/JSTSP.2019.2925975", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  For millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)\nsystems, hybrid processing architecture is usually used to reduce the\ncomplexity and cost, which poses a very challenging issue in channel\nestimation. In this paper, deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed\nto address this problem. We first propose a spatial-frequency CNN (SF-CNN)\nbased channel estimation exploiting both the spatial and frequency correlation,\nwhere the corrupted channel matrices at adjacent subcarriers are input into the\nCNN simultaneously. Then, exploiting the temporal correlation in time-varying\nchannels, a spatial-frequency-temporal CNN (SFT-CNN) based approach is\ndeveloped to further improve the accuracy. Moreover, we design a spatial\npilot-reduced CNN (SPR-CNN) to save spatial pilot overhead for channel\nestimation, where channels in several successive coherence intervals are\ngrouped and estimated by a channel estimation unit with memory. Numerical\nresults show that the proposed SF-CNN and SFT-CNN based approaches outperform\nthe non-ideal minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimator but with reduced\ncomplexity, and achieve the performance close to the ideal MMSE estimator that\nis very difficult to be implemented in practical situations. They are also\nrobust to different propagation scenarios.

Using these, we then derive the probability of sensing the event at time\nt, termed event-sensing probability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 21 Apr 2019 05:05:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-23", "authors_parsed": [["Pandey", "Kaushlendra K.", ""], ["Gupta", "Abhishek K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.09563", "submitter": "Himanshu Tyagi", "authors": "Madhu Sudan, Himanshu Tyagi, Shun Watanabe", "title": "Communication for Generating Correlation: A Unifying Survey", "comments": "A review article to appear in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The task of manipulating correlated random variables in a distributed setting\nhas received attention in the fields of both Information Theory and Computer\nScience.

Prior work focused on the design of the LIS\nreflection matrices assuming full knowledge of the channels. Estimating these\nchannels at the LIS, however, is a key challenging problem, and is associated\nwith large training overhead given the massive number of LIS elements. This\npaper proposes efficient solutions for these problems by leveraging tools from\ncompressive sensing and deep learning. First, a novel LIS architecture based on\nsparse channel sensors is proposed. In this architecture, all the LIS elements\nare passive except for a few elements that are active (connected to the\nbaseband of the LIS controller). We then develop two solutions that design the\nLIS reflection matrices with negligible training overhead. In the first\napproach, we leverage compressive sensing tools to construct the channels at\nall the LIS elements from the channels seen only at the active elements.

The resultant mixed timescale design\nproblem is an anticausal problem because the optimal cache allocation depends\non the future file requests. To handle it, a two-stage optimization scheme is\nproposed by utilizing historical knowledge of users' requests and channel state\ninformation. Specifically, the online content delivery design is tackled with a\npenalty-based approach, and the periodic cache updating is optimized with a\ndistributed alternating method. Simulation results indicate that the proposed\nscheme significantly outperforms conventional schemes and performs extremely\nclose to a genie-aided lower bound in the low caching region.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Apr 2019 15:52:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-25", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Xiongwei", ""], ["Li", "Qiang", ""], ["Li", "Xiuhua", ""], ["Leung", "Victor C.

Using tools from angular momentum analysis in\nquantum mechanics, we provide a new expression for the mutual coherence, which\nencourages the use of regular elevation samples. We construct low coherence\ndeterministic matrices by fixing the regular samples on the elevation and\nminimizing the mutual coherence over the azimuth-polarization choice. It is\nshown that once the elevation sampling is fixed, the mutual coherence has a\nlower bound that depends only on the elevation samples. This lower bound,\nhowever, can be achieved for spherical harmonics, which leads to new sensing\nmatrices with better coherence than other representative regular sampling\npatterns. This is reflected as well in our numerical experiments where our\nproposed sampling patterns perfectly match the phase transition of random\nsampling patterns.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Apr 2019 21:22:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 24 Feb 2020 22:46:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-22", "authors_parsed": [["Bangun", "Arya", ""], ["Behboodi", "Arash", ""], ["Mathar", "Rudolf", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.11632", "submitter": "Anshuka Rangi", "authors": "Anshuka Rangi and Massimo Franceschetti", "title": "Non-Stochastic Information Theory", "comments": "A subset of the results are published at IEEE International Symposium\n  on Information Theory (ISIT) 2019; Submitted to IEEE Transactions on\n  Information Theory", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In an effort to develop the foundations for a non-stochastic theory of\ninformation, the notion of $\\delta$-mutual information between uncertain\nvariables is introduced as a generalization of Nair's non-stochastic\ninformation functional.

Gradient coding is a coding-theoretic\nframework to mitigate stragglers by enabling the server to recover the gradient\nsum in the presence of stragglers. 'Approximate gradient codes' are variants of\ngradient codes that reduce computation and storage overhead per worker by\nallowing the server to approximately reconstruct the gradient sum.\n  In this work, our goal is to construct approximate gradient codes that are\nresilient to stragglers selected by a computationally unbounded adversary. Our\nmotivation for constructing codes to mitigate adversarial stragglers stems from\nthe challenge of tackling stragglers in massive-scale elastic and serverless\nsystems, wherein it is difficult to statistically model stragglers. Towards\nthis end, we propose a class of approximate gradient codes based on balanced\nincomplete block designs (BIBDs). We show that the approximation error for\nthese codes depends only on the number of stragglers, and thus, adversarial\nstraggler selection has no advantage over random selection. In addition, the\nproposed codes admit computationally efficient decoding at the server. Next, to\ncharacterize fundamental limits of adversarial straggling, we consider the\nnotion of 'adversarial threshold' -- the smallest number of workers that an\nadversary must straggle to inflict certain approximation error. We compute a\nlower bound on the adversarial threshold, and show that codes based on\nsymmetric BIBDs maximize this lower bound among a wide class of codes, making\nthem excellent candidates for mitigating adversarial stragglers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Apr 2019 17:13:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Kadhe", "Swanand", ""], ["Koyluoglu", "O.
