The number of sensing stages and the sensing technique per\nstage can be used to optimize performance with respect to secondary user\nthroughput and the collision probability between primary and secondary users.\nSo far, the impact of multi-stage sensing on network throughput and collision\nprobability for a realistic network model is relatively unexplored. Therefore,\nwe present the first analytical framework which enables performance evaluation\nof different multi-channel multi-stage spectrum sensing algorithms for\nOpportunistic Spectrum Access networks. The contribution of our work lies in\nstudying the effect of the following parameters on performance: number of\nsensing stages, physical layer sensing techniques and durations per each stage,\nsingle and parallel channel sensing and access, number of available channels,\nprimary and secondary user traffic, buffering of incoming secondary user\ntraffic, as well as MAC layer sensing algorithms. Analyzed performance metrics\ninclude the average secondary user throughput and the average collision\nprobability between primary and secondary users. Our results show that when the\nprobability of primary user mis-detection is constrained, the performance of\nmulti-stage sensing is, in most cases, superior to the single stage sensing\ncounterpart. Besides, prolonged channel observation at the first stage of\nsensing decreases the collision probability considerably, while keeping the\nthroughput at an acceptable level. Finally, in realistic primary user traffic\nscenarios, using two stages of sensing provides a good balance between\nsecondary users throughput and collision probability while meeting successful\ndetection constraints subjected by Opportunistic Spectrum Access communication.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Oct 2010 00:45:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 21 Nov 2010 20:36:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 7 Apr 2011 23:21:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 29 Aug 2012 08:37:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-30", "authors_parsed": [["Gabran", "Wesam", ""], ["Pawe\u0142czak", "Przemys\u0142aw", ""], ["\u010cabri\u0107", "Danijela", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.0060", "submitter": "Hironori Uchikawa", "authors": "Hironori Uchikawa, Kenta Kasai and Kohichi Sakaniwa", "title": "Design and Performance of Rate-compatible Non-Binary LDPC Convolutional\n  Codes", "comments": "8 pages, submitted to IEICE transaction", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1587/transfun.E94.A.2135", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we present a construction method of non-binary low-density\nparity-check (LDPC) convolutional codes.

First, we introduce an undirected graph on all possible configurations\nof the digraph, referred to as the guessing graph, which encapsulates the\nessence of dependence amongst configurations. We prove that the guessing number\nof a digraph is equal to the logarithm of the independence number of its\nguessing graph. Therefore, network coding solvability is no more a problem on\nthe operations made by each node, but is simplified into a problem on the\nmessages that can transit through the network. By studying the guessing graph\nof a given digraph, and how to combine digraphs or alphabets, we are thus able\nto derive bounds on the guessing number of digraphs. Second, we construct\nspecific digraphs with high guessing numbers, yielding network coding instances\nwhere a large amount of information can transit. We first propose a\nconstruction of digraphs with finite parameters based on cyclic codes, with\nguessing number equal to the degree of the generator polynomial. We then\nconstruct an infinite class of digraphs with arbitrary girth for which the\nratio between the linear guessing number and the number of vertices tends to\none, despite these digraphs being arbitrarily sparse.

A novel coding that integrates simultaneously DF and CF schemes is\nproposed and an inner bound on the capacity region is derived for the case of\ngeneral memoryless BRCs.

In the proposed model, a\nnumber of agents are required to collect data from several arbitrarily located\ntasks.

The main goal of this paper is to introduce a statistical model that\ntakes such dependencies into account and show how this model can be used for\nsparse signal recovery.

Exploiting this structure, we develop an efficient\nmessage passing algorithm that recovers the underlying signal. When the model\nparameters defining the underlying graph are unknown, we suggest an algorithm\nthat learns these parameters directly from the data, leading to an iterative\nscheme for adaptive sparse signal recovery.

However, Takens' theorem is fragile in the sense that even small\nimperfections can induce arbitrarily large errors in this attractor\nrepresentation. We extend Takens' result to establish deterministic, explicit\nand non-asymptotic sufficient conditions for a delay coordinate map to form a\nstable embedding in the restricted case of linear dynamical systems and\nobservation functions. Our work is inspired by the field of Compressive Sensing\n(CS), where results guarantee that low-dimensional signal families can be\nrobustly reconstructed if they are stably embedded by a measurement operator.\nHowever, in contrast to typical CS results, i) our sufficient conditions are\nindependent of the size of the ambient state space, and ii) some system and\nmeasurement pairs have fundamental limits on the conditioning of the embedding\n(i.e., how close it is to an isometry), meaning that further measurements\nbeyond some point add no further significant value. We use several simple\nsimulations to explore the conditions of the main results, including the\ntightness of the bounds and the convergence speed of the stable embedding. We\nalso present an example task of estimating the attractor dimension from\ntime-series data to highlight the value of stable embeddings over traditional\nTakens' embeddings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Oct 2010 12:20:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 1 Apr 2011 14:43:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 18 Jun 2011 12:57:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Yap", "Han Lun", ""], ["Rozell", "Christopher J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.6020", "submitter": "Shrinivas Kudekar Mr.", "authors": "Shrinivas Kudekar, Henry D.

The fundamental reason for this was attributed to a \"threshold\nsaturation\" phenomena derived by Kudekar, Richardson and Urbanke. In\nparticular, it was shown that the belief propagation (BP) threshold of the\nspatially coupled codes is equal to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding\nthreshold of the underlying constituent codes. In this sense, the BP threshold\nis saturated to its maximum value. Moreover, it has been empirically observed\nthat the same phenomena also occurs when transmitting over more general classes\nof BMS channels. In this paper, we show that the effect of spatial coupling is\nnot restricted to the realm of channel coding. The effect of coupling also\nmanifests itself in compressed sensing. Specifically, we show that\nspatially-coupled measurement matrices have an improved sparsity to sampling\nthreshold for reconstruction algorithms based on verification decoding. For\nBP-based reconstruction algorithms, this phenomenon is also tested empirically\nvia simulation. At the block lengths accessible via simulation, the effect is\nquite small and it seems that spatial coupling is not providing the gains one\nmight expect. Based on the threshold analysis, however, we believe this\nwarrants further study.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Oct 2010 17:14:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-29", "authors_parsed": [["Kudekar", "Shrinivas", ""], ["Pfister", "Henry D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.6057", "submitter": "Raef Bassily", "authors": "Raef Bassily and Sennur Ulukus", "title": "Ergodic Secret Alignment", "comments": "Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, October 2010", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.CR math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we introduce two new achievable schemes for the fading\nmultiple access wiretap channel (MAC-WT).

While we\nachieve this alignment through signal scaling at the transmitters in our first\nscheme (scaling based alignment (SBA)), we let nature provide this alignment\nthrough the ergodicity of the channel coefficients in the second scheme\n(ergodic secret alignment (ESA)). For each scheme, we obtain the resulting\nachievable secrecy rate region. We show that the secrecy rates achieved by both\nschemes scale with SNR as 1/2log(SNR). Hence, we show the sub-optimality of the\ni.i.d. Gaussian signaling based schemes with and without cooperative jamming by\nshowing that the secrecy rates achieved using i.i.d. Gaussian signaling with\ncooperative jamming do not scale with SNR. In addition, we introduce an\nimproved version of our ESA scheme where we incorporate cooperative jamming to\nachieve higher secrecy rates.

The power-rate relationship\nfor this problem is assumed to be an increasing concave function, as dictated\nby information theory. For battery replenishment, a model with discrete packets\nof energy arrivals is considered.

The channel\nassociated with the relay is thus an out-of-band relay channel (OBRC). The\nfocus is on a symmetric channel model, in order to assess the fundamental\nimpact of the OBRC on the signal interaction of the IC, in the simplest\npossible setting. First, the linear deterministic model is investigated and the\nsum capacity of this channel is established for all possible channel\nparameters. In particular, it is observed that the impact of OBRC, as its links\nget stronger, is similar to that of output feedback for the IC. The insights\nobtained from the deterministic model are then used to design achievable\nschemes for the Gaussian model. The interference links are classified as\nextremely strong, very strong, strong, moderate, weak, and very weak. For\nstrong and moderate interference, separate encoding is near optimal. For very\nstrong and extremely strong interference, the interference links provide side\ninformation to the destinations, which can help the transmission through the\nOBRC. For weak or very weak interference, an extension of the Han-Kobayashi\nscheme for the IC is utilized, where the messages are split into common and\nprivate. To achieve higher rates, it is beneficial to further split the common\nmessage into two parts, and the OBRC plays an important role in decoding the\ncommon message. It is shown that our strategy achieves the symmetric capacity\nto within 1.14625 bits per channel use with duplexing factor 0.5, and 1.27125\nbits per channel use for arbitrary duplexing factors, for all channel\nparameters. An important observation from the constant gap result is that\nstrong interference can be beneficial with the presence of an OBR.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Oct 2010 18:39:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 21 Mar 2012 01:31:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Tian", "Ye", ""], ["Yener", "Aylin", ""]]}]
