Moreover we prove that our construction\nmaintains information about the original set. Other well known methods to\ncompare sets are considered, such as the symmetric difference distance between\nclassical sets and the sup-distance between fuzzy sets. Also in these cases we\npresent results stating that the multidimensional matching distance between\nrank invariants of persistent homology groups is upperly bounded by these\ndistances.

Each pool is then tested and defective items are\nidentified. A fundamental question involves minimizing the number of pools\nrequired to identify at most $d$ defective items. Motivated by applications in\nnetwork tomography, sensor networks and infection propagation, a variation of\ngroup testing problems on graphs is formulated. Unlike conventional group\ntesting problems, each group here must conform to the constraints imposed by a\ngraph. For instance, items can be associated with vertices and each pool is any\nset of nodes that must be path connected. In this paper, a test is associated\nwith a random walk. In this context, conventional group testing corresponds to\nthe special case of a complete graph on $n$ vertices.\n  For interesting classes of graphs a rather surprising result is obtained,\nnamely, that the number of tests required to identify $d$ defective items is\nsubstantially similar to what is required in conventional group testing\nproblems, where no such constraints on pooling is imposed. Specifically, if\nT(n) corresponds to the mixing time of the graph $G$, it is shown that with\n$m=O(d^2T^2(n)\\log(n/d))$ non-adaptive tests, one can identify the defective\nitems. Consequently, for the Erdos-Renyi random graph $G(n,p)$, as well as\nexpander graphs with constant spectral gap, it follows that $m=O(d^2\\log^3n)$\nnon-adaptive tests are sufficient to identify $d$ defective items. Next, a\nspecific scenario is considered that arises in network tomography, for which it\nis shown that $m=O(d^3\\log^3n)$ non-adaptive tests are sufficient to identify\n$d$ defective items.

Our analytical results demonstrate that the spatial density of\nprogress scales as the square root of the density of users, and the optimal\ncontention density (that maximizes the spatial density of progress) is\nindependent of the density of users.

The CB average beampattern expresses a deterministic\nbehavior and can be used for characterizing/controling the transmission at\nintended direction(s), since the mainlobe of the CB beampattern is independent\non the particular random node locations. However, the CB for a cluster formed\nby a limited number of collaborative nodes results in a sample beampattern with\nsidelobes that severely depend on the particular node locations. High level\nsidelobes can cause unacceptable interference when they occur at directions of\nunintended BSs/APs. Therefore, sidelobe control in CB has a potential to\nincrease the network capacity and wireless channel availability by decreasing\nthe interference. Traditional sidelobe control techniques are proposed for\ncentralized antenna arrays and, therefore, are not suitable for WSNs. In this\npaper, we show that distributed, scalable, and low-complexity sidelobe control\ntechniques suitable for CB in WSNs can be developed based on node selection\ntechnique which make use of the randomness of the node locations. A node\nselection algorithm with low-rate feedback is developed to search over\ndifferent node combinations. The performance of the proposed algorithm is\nanalyzed in terms of the average number of trials required to select the\ncollaborative nodes and the resulting interference.

There are\nnumerous applications for DPC, including coding for broadcast channels.\nRecently, lattice-based coding techniques have provided several designs for\nDPC. In lattice-based DPC, there are two codes - a convolutional code that\ndefines a lattice used for shaping and an error correction code used for\nchannel coding. Several specific designs have been reported in the recent\nliterature using convolutional and graph-based codes for capacity-approaching\nshaping and coding gains. In most of the reported designs, either the encoder\nworks on a joint trellis of shaping and channel codes or the decoder requires\niterations between the shaping and channel decoders. This results in high\ncomplexity of implementation. In this work, we present a lattice-based DPC\nscheme that provides good shaping and coding gains with moderate complexity at\nboth the encoder and the decoder. We use a convolutional code for sign-bit\nshaping, and a low-density parity check (LDPC) code for channel coding. The\ncrucial idea is the introduction of a one-codeword delay and careful parsing of\nthe bits at the transmitter, which enable an LDPC decoder to be run first at\nthe receiver.

The goal is\nto allow for a reduced delay collection by a data collector who accesses the\nnetwork at a random position and random time. Data dissemination is performed\nby a set of relays which form a circular route to exchange source packets. The\nstorage nodes within the transmission range of the route's relays linearly\ncombine and store overheard relay transmissions using random decentralized\nstrategies. An intelligent data collector first collects a minimum set of coded\npackets from a subset of storage nodes in its proximity, which might be\nsufficient for recovering the original packets and, by using a message-passing\ndecoder, attempts recovering all original source packets from this set.\nWhenever the decoder stalls, the source packet which restarts decoding is\npolled/doped from its original source node. The random-walk-based analysis of\nthe decoding/doping process furnishes the collection delay analysis with a\nprediction on the number of required doped packets. The number of doped packets\ncan be surprisingly small when employed with an Ideal Soliton code degree\ndistribution and, hence, the doping strategy may have the least collection\ndelay when the density of source nodes is sufficiently large. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that network coding makes dissemination more efficient at the\nexpense of a larger collection delay.

In this paper, we\nmodel different types of random network communications as the transmission of\nflats of matroids. This novel framework encompasses RLNC and SAF and allows us\nto introduce a novel protocol, referred to as random affine network coding\n(RANC), based on affine combinations of packets. Although the models previously\nproposed for RLNC and SAF only consider error control, using our framework, we\nfirst evaluate and compare the performance of different network protocols in\nthe error-free case. We define and determine the rate, average delay, and\nthroughput of such protocols, and we also investigate the possibilities of\npartial decoding before the entire message is received. We thus show that RANC\noutperforms RLNC in terms of data rate and throughput thanks to a more\nefficient encoding of messages into packets. Second, we model the possible\nalterations of a message by the network as an operator channel, which\ngeneralizes the channels proposed for RLNC and SAF. Error control is thus\nreduced to a coding-theoretic problem on flats of a matroid, where two distinct\nmetrics can be used for error correction. We study the maximum cardinality of\ncodes on flats in general, and codes for error correction in RANC in\nparticular. We finally design a class of nearly optimal codes for RANC based on\nrank metric codes for which we propose a low-complexity decoding algorithm. The\ngain of RANC over RLNC is thus preserved with no additional cost in terms of\ncomplexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jan 2010 14:13:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 9 Mar 2010 14:34:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 18 Oct 2010 15:17:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Gadouleau", "Maximilien", ""], ["Goupil", "Alban", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.5311", "submitter": "Jarvis Haupt", "authors": "Jarvis Haupt, Rui Castro, and Robert Nowak", "title": "Distilled Sensing: Adaptive Sampling for Sparse Detection and Estimation", "comments": "23 pages, 2 figures.
