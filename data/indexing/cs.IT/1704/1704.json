Since providing grid power supply in support of MEC can be costly and\neven infeasible in some scenarios, on-site renewable energy is mandated as a\nmajor or even sole power supply. Nonetheless, the high intermittency and\nunpredictability of energy harvesting creates many new challenges of performing\neffective MEC. In this paper, we develop an algorithm called GLOBE that\nperforms joint geographical load balancing (GLB) and admission control for\noptimizing the system performance of a network of MEC-enabled and energy\nharvesting-powered base stations. By leveraging and extending the Lyapunov\noptimization with perturbation technique, GLOBE operates online without\nrequiring future system information and addresses significant challenges caused\nby battery state dynamics and energy causality constraints. Moreover, GLOBE\nworks in a distributed manner, which makes our algorithm scalable to large\nnetworks. We prove that GLOBE achieves a close-to-optimal system performance\ncompared to the offline algorithm that knows full future information, and\npresent a critical tradeoff between battery capacity and system performance.\nSimulation results validate our analysis and demonstrate the superior\nperformance of GLOBE compared to benchmark algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Apr 2017 02:37:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 27 Oct 2017 20:22:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 23 Dec 2017 22:22:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-27", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Jie", ""], ["Wu", "Hang", ""], ["Chen", "Lixing", ""], ["Shen", "Cong", ""], ["Wen", "Wujie", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.00116", "submitter": "Renbo Zhao", "authors": "Renbo Zhao, William B.

For every\n$\\epsilon >0$, synchronization strings allow to index a sequence with an\n$\\epsilon^{-O(1)}$ size alphabet such that one can efficiently transform $k$\nsynchronization errors into $(1+\\epsilon)k$ half-errors.

In this paper, we focus on designing insdel\ncodes, i.e., error correcting block codes (ECCs) for insertion deletion\nchannels.\n  While ECCs for both half-errors and synchronization errors have been\nintensely studied, the later has largely resisted progress. Indeed, it took\nuntil 1999 for the first insdel codes with constant rate, constant distance,\nand constant alphabet size to be constructed by Schulman and Zuckerman. Insdel\ncodes for asymptotically large or small noise rates were given in 2016 by\nGuruswami et al. but these codes are still polynomially far from the optimal\nrate-distance tradeoff. This makes the understanding of insdel codes up to this\nwork equivalent to what was known for regular ECCs after Forney introduced\nconcatenated codes in his doctoral thesis 50 years ago.\n  A direct application of our synchronization strings based indexing method\ngives a simple black-box construction which transforms any ECC into an equally\nefficient insdel code with a slightly larger alphabet size.

In contrast to\ntraditional signal processing, the irregularity of the signal domain makes\nselecting a sampling set non-trivial and hard to analyze. Indeed, though\nconditions for graph signal interpolation from noiseless samples exist, they do\nnot lead to a unique sampling set. The presence of noise makes choosing among\nthese sampling sets a hard combinatorial problem. Although greedy sampling\nschemes are commonly used in practice, they have no performance guarantee.

In contrast to currently available bounds, they are not\nrestricted to specific sampling schemes and hold for any sampling sets. Second,\nthis paper provides near-optimal guarantees for greedy sampling by introducing\nthe concept of approximate submodularity and updating the classical greedy\nbound.

Caching popular content at the network edge\nhas emerged to be a solution for low-latency content delivery. Compared with\nthe traditional wireless communication, content delivery has a key\ncharacteristic that many signals coexisting in the air carry identical popular\ncontent. They, however, can interfere with each other at a receiver if their\nmodulation-and-coding (MAC) schemes are adapted to individual channels\nfollowing the classic approach. To address this issue, we present a novel idea\nof content adaptive MAC (CAMAC) where adapting MAC schemes to content ensures\nthat all signals carry identical content are encoded using an identical MAC\nscheme, achieving spatial MAC alignment. Consequently, interference can be\nharnessed as signals, to improve the reliability of wireless delivery.

Specifically,\ncontent helpers are distributed as a Poisson point process, each of which\ntransmits a file from a content database based on a given popularity\ndistribution. It is discovered that the successful content-delivery probability\nis closely related to the distribution of the ratio of two independent shot\nnoise processes, named a shot-noise ratio. The distribution itself is an open\nmathematical problem that we tackle in this work. Using stable-distribution\ntheory and tools from stochastic geometry, the distribution function is derived\nin closed form.

In particular, implementing\nmassive MIMO in the digital domain requires hundreds of RF chains matching the\nnumber of antennas. Furthermore, designing these components to operate at the\nmmWave frequencies is challenging and costly. These motivated the recent\ndevelopment of hybrid-beamforming where MIMO processing is divided for separate\nimplementation in the analog and digital domains, called the analog and digital\nbeamforming, respectively.

In this regard, the problem is\naddressed using a novel framework based on matching theory that is composed to\ntwo, highly inter-related stages: a multi-hop network formation stage and a\nresource management stage. One unique feature of this framework is that it\njointly accounts for both wireless channel characteristics and economic factors\nduring both network formation and resource management. The multi-hop network\nformation stage is formulated as a one-to-many matching game which is solved\nusing a novel algorithm, that builds on the so-called deferred acceptance\nalgorithm and is shown to yield a stable and Pareto optimal multi-hop mmW\nbackhaul network.

This paper establishes conditions for energy\nconservation (and thus for a trivial null-set) for a wide class of deep\nconvolutional neural network-based feature extractors and characterizes\ncorresponding feature map energy decay rates. Specifically, we consider general\nscattering networks employing the modulus non-linearity and we find that under\nmild analyticity and high-pass conditions on the filters (which encompass,\ninter alia, various constructions of Weyl-Heisenberg filters, wavelets,\nridgelets, ($\\alpha$)-curvelets, and shearlets) the feature map energy decays\nat least polynomially fast. For broad families of wavelets and Weyl-Heisenberg\nfilters, the guaranteed decay rate is shown to be exponential. Moreover, we\nprovide handy estimates of the number of layers needed to have at least\n$((1-\\varepsilon)\\cdot 100)\\%$ of the input signal energy be contained in the\nfeature vector.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Apr 2017 06:27:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 11 Sep 2017 07:04:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 1 Feb 2018 08:31:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Wiatowski", "Thomas", ""], ["Grohs", "Philipp", ""], ["B\u00f6lcskei", "Helmut", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.03761", "submitter": "Juan Jacobo Sim\\'on-Pinero", "authors": "J.

These relays, deployed every few hundred meters, serve the\nusers in their vicinity and are backhauled to the base station through wireless\nconnections. In this work, the wireless relayed backhaul design has been\nformulated as a topology-bandwidth-power joint optimization problem, and the\ninfluence of path loss, angular spread, array size, and RF power limitation on\nthe user rate has been evaluated. It has been shown that for a linear network\ndeployed along the street at 28 GHz, when high joint directional gain (50 dBi)\nis available, 1 Gbps user rate within cell range of 1 km can be delivered using\n1.5 GHz of bandwidth (using single polarization antennas). The user rates drop\nprecipitously when joint directional gain is reduced, or when the path loss is\nmuch more severe. When the number of RF chains is limited, the benefit of\nlarger arrays will eventually be surpassed by the increased channel estimation\npenalty as the effective beamforming gain saturates owing to the channel\nangular spread.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:37:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 7 May 2018 16:40:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-08", "authors_parsed": [["Du", "Jinfeng", ""], ["Onaran", "Efe", ""], ["Chizhik", "Dmitry", ""], ["Venkatesan", "Sivarama", ""], ["Valenzuela", "Reinaldo A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.04365", "submitter": "Jianhua Mo", "authors": "Jianhua Mo and Robert W.

Channel estimation for\none-bit massive MIMO systems is challenging due to the severe distortion caused\nby the coarse quantization. It was shown in previous studies that an extremely\nlong training sequence is required to attain an acceptable performance. In this\npaper, we study the problem of optimal one-bit quantization design for channel\nestimation in one-bit massive MIMO systems. Our analysis reveals that, if the\nquantization thresholds are optimally devised, using one-bit ADCs can achieve\nan estimation error close to (with an increase by a factor of $\\pi/2$) that of\nan ideal estimator which has access to the unquantized data. The optimal\nquantization thresholds, however, are dependent on the unknown channel\nparameters. To cope with this difficulty, we propose an adaptive quantization\n(AQ) approach in which the thresholds are adaptively adjusted in a way such\nthat the thresholds converge to the optimal thresholds, and a random\nquantization (RQ) scheme which randomly generate a set of nonidentical\nthresholds based on some statistical prior knowledge of the channel. Simulation\nresults show that, our proposed AQ and RQ schemes, owing to their wisely\ndevised thresholds, present a significant performance improvement over the\nconventional fixed quantization scheme that uses a fixed (typically zero)\nthreshold, and meanwhile achieve a substantial training overhead reduction for\nchannel estimation.

Instead of computing long dot products as\nrequired in the original linear transform, we construct a larger number of\nredundant and short dot products that can be computed faster and more\nefficiently at individual processors. In reference to comparable schemes that\nintroduce redundancy to tackle stragglers, Short-Dot reduces the cost of\ncomputation, storage and communication since shorter portions are stored and\ncomputed at each processor, and also shorter portions of the input is\ncommunicated to each processor.

We investigate the effect and potential of different labelings for\nsuch a set-up using per-bit EXIT curves, and exemplify the method for a 16-QAM\nsystem, e.g., using set partitioning labelings. A hybrid mapping is proposed,\nwhere different sub-blocks use different labelings in order to further optimize\nthe decoding thresholds of tail-biting codes, while the computational\ncomplexity overhead through iterative demapping remains small.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Apr 2017 16:15:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-19", "authors_parsed": [["Cammerer", "Sebastian", ""], ["Schmalen", "Laurent", ""], ["Aref", "Vahid", ""], ["Brink", "Stephan ten", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.05432", "submitter": "Mehdi Teimouri", "authors": "Mehdi Teimouri and Hamidreza Kakaei Motlagh", "title": "Reverse Engineering of Communications Networks: Evolution and Challenges", "comments": "18 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Reverse engineering of a communications network is the process of identifying\nthe communications protocol used in the network.

Moreover, due to the limited available RF spectrum, we assume\nthat the RF multiple-access and fronthaul links employ the same RF resources.\nThereby, we propose an adaptive protocol which allocates transmission time to\nthe RF multiple-access and fronthaul links in a time division duplex (TDD)\nmanner and optimizes the quantization noise covariance matrix at each RU such\nthat the sum rate is maximized. Our simulation results reveal that a\nconsiderable gain in terms of sum rate can be achieved by the proposed protocol\nin comparison with benchmark schemes from the literature, especially when the\nFSO links experience unfavorable atmospheric conditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Apr 2017 12:47:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["Najafi", "Marzieh", ""], ["Jamali", "Vahid", ""], ["Ng", "Derrick Wing Kwan", ""], ["Schober", "Robert", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.05741", "submitter": "Rodrigo de Lamare", "authors": "M.

The proposed scheme includes two steps: designing the\nbeamforming vectors of the useful confidential messages and constructing\nartificial noise (AN) projection matrix.

We first solve the single-hop version of this problem, and\nthen show that the two-hop problem is solved by treating the source and relay\nnodes as one combined node, with some parameter transformations, and solving a\nsingle-hop problem between that combined node and the destination.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Apr 2017 17:50:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 6 Dec 2017 15:26:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-07", "authors_parsed": [["Arafa", "Ahmed", ""], ["Ulukus", "Sennur", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.08688", "submitter": "Shujaat Khan Engr", "authors": "Muhammad Usman, Irfan Ahmed, M.
