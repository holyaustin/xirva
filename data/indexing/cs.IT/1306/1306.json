In the presence of\nergodic fading, communicating the channel state information (CSI) from the BSs\nto the CU may require a sizable part of the backhaul capacity. In a prior work,\nthis aspect was studied by assuming a Compress-Forward-Estimate (CFE) approach,\nwhereby the BSs compress the training signal and CSI estimation takes place at\nthe CU. In this work, instead, an Estimate-Compress-Forward (ECF) approach is\ninvestigated, whereby the BSs perform CSI estimation and forward a compressed\nversion of the CSI to the CU. This choice is motivated by the information\ntheoretic optimality of separate estimation and compression. Various ECF\nstrategies are proposed that perform either separate or joint compression of\nestimated CSI and received signal.

Most of the methods reported thus far rely on\nthe assumption of (almost) flat subchannels to more easily tackle this problem,\naddressing it in a way similar to OFDM.

The goal of this paper is to revisit this problem through an\nalternative formulation that focuses on the estimation of the channel impulse\nresponse itself and makes no assumption on the degree of frequency selectivity\nof the subchannels.

The algorithm, termed Compressive Adaptive Sense and\nSearch (CASS), is shown to be near-optimal in that it succeeds at the lowest\npossible signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) levels, improving on previous work in\nadaptive compressed sensing. Like traditional compressed sensing based on\nrandom non-adaptive design matrices, the CASS algorithm requires only k log n\nmeasurements to recover a k-sparse signal of dimension n. However, CASS\nsucceeds at SNR levels that are a factor log n less than required by standard\ncompressed sensing. From the point of view of constructing and implementing the\nsensing operation as well as computing the reconstruction, the proposed\nalgorithm is substantially less computationally intensive than standard\ncompressed sensing. CASS is also demonstrated to perform considerably better in\npractice through simulation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\ndemonstration of an adaptive compressed sensing algorithm with near-optimal\ntheoretical guarantees and excellent practical performance. This paper also\nshows that methods like compressed sensing, group testing, and pooling have an\nadvantage beyond simply reducing the number of measurements or tests --\nadaptive versions of such methods can also improve detection and estimation\nperformance when compared to non-adaptive direct (uncompressed) sensing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Jun 2013 13:39:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 29 Apr 2014 14:52:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-30", "authors_parsed": [["Malloy", "Matthew L.", ""], ["Nowak", "Robert D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.6260", "submitter": "Oleksandr Nikitin", "authors": "Oleksandr Nikitin", "title": "Information-Theoretic Security for the Masses", "comments": "4 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.CY cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  We combine interactive zero-knowledge protocols and weak physical layer\nrandomness properties to construct a protocol which allows bootstrapping an\nIT-secure and PF-secure channel from a memorizable shared secret.

In\nfrequency-selective channels, Tx-BF can be implemented in combination with\nsingle-carrier frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) to combat inter-symbol\ninterference. In this paper, we consider the optimal design of the Tx-BF matrix\nfor a MIMO SC-FDE system employing a linear minimum mean square error (MSE)\nreceiver. We formulate the Tx-BF optimization problem as the minimization of a\ngeneral function of the stream MSEs, subject to a transmit power constraint.\nThe optimal structure of the Tx-BF matrix is obtained in closed form and an\nefficient algorithm is proposed for computing the optimal power allocation. Our\nsimulation results validate the excellent performance of the proposed scheme in\nterms of uncoded bit-error rate and achievable bit rate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Jun 2013 18:34:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Peiran", ""], ["Schober", "Robert", ""], ["Bhargava", "Vijay K.", ""]]}]
