We assume that the\nsecondary users access the spectrum by utilizing a strategy that is a\ncombination of underlay and interweave access techniques. Considering that the\nsecondary users imperfectly perform channel sensing in order to detect the\nactive primary users and that there is a transmission deadline for each data\npacket at the secondary transmitter buffer, we formulate the state-transition\nmodel of the system. Then, we obtain the state-transition probabilities when\nHARQ-chase combining is adopted. Subsequently, we provide the packet-loss rate\nin the channel and achieve the effective capacity. Finally, we substantiate our\nanalytical derivations with numerical results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 4 Feb 2017 01:25:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Akin", "Sami", ""], ["Hammouda", "Marwan", ""], ["Peissig", "J\u00fcrgen", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.01223", "submitter": "Nguyen Dinh van", "authors": "Van-Dinh Nguyen, Hieu V.

The key\nidea of FD is to serve multiple users over the same bandwidth with a base\nstation (BS) that can simultaneously transmit and receive the signals. The most\nchallenging issue in designing an FD system is to address both the harmful\neffects of residual self-interference caused by the transmit-to-receive\nantennas at the BS as well as the co- channel interference from an uplink user\n(ULU) to a downlink user (DLU). An efficient solution to these problems is to\nassign the ULUs/DLUs in different groups/slots, with each user served in\nmultiple groups. Hence, this paper studies the joint design of transmit\nbeamformers, ULUs/DLUs group assignment, and time allocation for each group.\nThe specific aim is to maximize the sum rate under the ULU/DLU minimum\nthroughput constraints. The utility function of interest is a difficult\nnonconcave problem, and the involved constraints are also nonconvex, and so\nthis is a computationally troublesome problem. To solve this optimization\nproblem, we propose a new path-following algorithm for compu- tational\nsolutions to arrive at least the local optima. Each iteration involves only a\nsimple convex quadratic program. We prove that the proposed algorithm\niteratively improves the objective while guaranteeing convergence. Simulation\nresults confirm the fast convergence of the proposed algorithm with substantial\nperformance improvements over existing approaches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 4 Feb 2017 01:46:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Nguyen", "Van-Dinh", ""], ["Nguyen", "Hieu V.", ""], ["Nguyen", "Chuyen T.", ""], ["Shin", "Oh-Soon", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.01225", "submitter": "Taposh Banerjee", "authors": "Taposh Banerjee and Alfred O.

Recently, the Partial\nInformation Decomposition (PID) was proposed to decompose mutual information\n(MI) about a target variable into components which are redundant, unique and\nsynergistic within different subsets of predictor variables. Here, we propose\nto apply the elegant formalism of the PID to multivariate entropy, resulting in\na Partial Entropy Decomposition (PED). We implement the PED with an entropy\nredundancy measure based on pointwise common surprisal; a natural definition\nwhich is closely related to the definition of MI. We show how this approach can\nreveal the dyadic vs triadic generative structure of multivariate systems that\nare indistinguishable with classical Shannon measures. The entropy perspective\nalso shows that misinformation is synergistic entropy and hence that MI itself\nincludes both redundant and synergistic effects. We show the relationships\nbetween the PED and MI in two predictors, and derive two alternative\ninformation decompositions which we illustrate on several example systems. This\nreveals that in entropy terms, univariate predictor MI is not a proper subset\nof the joint MI, and we suggest this previously unrecognised fact explains in\npart why obtaining a consistent PID has proven difficult. The PED also allows\nseparate quantification of mechanistic redundancy (related to the function of\nthe system) versus source redundancy (arising from dependencies between\ninputs); an important distinction which no existing methods can address.

Most research to date have focused either on the physical\naspects of energy conversion process or on optimal consumption policy of the\nharvested energy at the system level. However, although intuitively understood,\nto the best of our knowledge, the idea of self-sustainability is yet to be made\nprecise and studied as a performance metric. In this paper, we provide a\nmathematical definition of the concept of self-sustainability of an energy\nharvesting system, based on the complementary idea of eventual outage. In\nparticular, we analyze the harvest-store-consume system with infinite battery\ncapacity, stochastic energy arrivals, and fixed energy consumption rate. Using\nthe random walk theory, we identify the necessary condition for the system to\nbe self-sustainable. General formulas are given for the self-sustainability\nprobability in the form of integral equations. Since these integral equations\nare difficult to solve analytically, an exponential upper bound for eventual\noutage probability is given using martingales. This bound guarantees that the\neventual outage probability can be made arbitrarily small simply by increasing\nthe initial battery energy. We also give an asymptotic formula for eventual\noutage. For the special case when the energy arrival follows a Poisson process,\nwe are able to find the exact formulas for the eventual outage probability. We\nalso show that the harvest-store-consume system is mathematically equivalent to\na $GI/G/1$ queueing system, which allows us to easily find the outage\nprobability, in case the necessary condition for self-sustainability is\nviolated.

The theoretically ideal\nimplementation is the use of minimal sufficient statistics, where it is\nwell-known that either X or Y can be replaced by their minimal sufficient\nstatistic about the other while preserving the mutual information. While\nintuitively reasonable, it is not obvious or straightforward that both\nvariables can be replaced simultaneously. We demonstrate that this is in fact\npossible: the information X's minimal sufficient statistic preserves about Y is\nexactly the information that Y's minimal sufficient statistic preserves about\nX. As an important corollary, we consider the case where one variable is a\nstochastic process' past and the other its future and the present is viewed as\na memoryful channel. In this case, the mutual information is the channel\ntransmission rate between the channel's effective states. That is, the\npast-future mutual information (the excess entropy) is the amount of\ninformation about the future that can be predicted using the past. Translating\nour result about minimal sufficient statistics, this is equivalent to the\nmutual information between the forward- and reverse-time causal states of\ncomputational mechanics. We close by discussing multivariate extensions to this\nuse of minimal sufficient statistics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Feb 2017 00:52:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-21", "authors_parsed": [["James", "Ryan G.", ""], ["Mahoney", "John R.", ""], ["Crutchfield", "James P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.01839", "submitter": "Ying Cui", "authors": "Jifang Xing, Ying Cui, Vincent Lau", "title": "Temporal-Spatial Aggregation for Cache-Enabled Wireless Multicasting\n  Networks with Asynchronous Content Requests", "comments": "5 pages, 2 figures, submitted to IEEE ISIT 2017", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Existing multicasting schemes for massive content delivery do not fully\nutilize multicasting opportunities in delay tolerant content-oriented\napplications.

The\nposterior probability density function of the received source signals and the\nexpression for the related marginal likelihood function are derived\ntheoretically.

An improved accuracy in terms of average root mean square\nerror values is achieved (up to 73.39% for the modified relevance vector\nmachine based approach and 86.36% for the Gibbs sampling based approach).

We study the associated trade-offs between error-rate performance,\ncomputational complexity, and interconnect bandwidth, and we demonstrate the\nscalability of our solutions for massive MU-MIMO systems with thousands of BS\nantennas using reference implementations on a graphic processing unit (GPU)\ncluster.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Feb 2017 03:40:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 15 Nov 2017 19:22:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Kaipeng", ""], ["Sharan", "Rishi", ""], ["Chen", "Yujun", ""], ["Goldstein", "Tom", ""], ["Cavallaro", "Joseph R.", ""], ["Studer", "Christoph", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.04466", "submitter": "Serge Kas Hanna", "authors": "Serge Kas Hanna, Salim El Rouayheb", "title": "Guess & Check Codes for Deletions and Synchronization", "comments": "Accepted in ISIT 2017", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the problem of constructing codes that can correct $\\delta$\ndeletions occurring in an arbitrary binary string of length $n$ bits.\nVarshamov-Tenengolts (VT) codes can correct all possible single deletions\n$(\\delta=1)$ with an asymptotically optimal redundancy.

The waveform design is based on the\nminimization of the integrated sidelobe level (ISL) and weighted ISL (WISL) of\nwaveforms. As the corresponding optimization problems can quickly grow to large\nscale with increasing the code length and number of waveforms, the main issue\nturns to be the development of fast large-scale optimization techniques. The\ndifficulty is also that the corresponding optimization problems are non-convex,\nbut the required accuracy is high. Therefore, we formulate the ISL and WISL\nminimization problems as non-convex quartic optimization problems in frequency\ndomain, and then simplify them into quadratic problems by utilizing the\nmajorization-minimization technique, which is one of the basic techniques for\naddressing large-scale and/or non-convex optimization problems. While designing\nour fast algorithms, we find out and use inherent algebraic structures in the\nobjective functions to rewrite them into quartic forms, and in the case of WISL\nminimization, to derive additionally an alternative quartic form which allows\nto apply the quartic-quadratic transformation. Our algorithms are applicable to\nlarge-scale unimodular waveform design problems as they are proved to have\nlower or comparable computational burden (analyzed theoretically) and faster\nconvergence speed (confirmed by comprehensive simulations) than the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms.

Based on the estimated CSI, zero-forcing\n(ZF) precoding is adopted for multiuser downlink transmission. In addition, we\nderive a tight achievable rate upper bound of the system. Our analytical and\nsimulation results show that the proposed scheme offer a considerable\nachievable rate gain compared to fully digital systems, where the number of RF\nchains equipped at each transceiver is equal to the number of antennas.\nFurthermore, the achievable rate performance gap between the considered hybrid\nmmWave systems and the fully digital system is characterized, which provides\nuseful system design insights.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Feb 2017 03:07:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-28", "authors_parsed": [["Zhao", "Lou", ""], ["Ng", "Derrick Wing Kwan", ""], ["Yuan", "Jinhong", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.08133", "submitter": "Stefano Rini", "authors": "Stefano Rini, Luca Barletta, Yonina C.
