Markov Random Fields (MRF) are structured, probabilistic\ngraphical models over undirected graphs, and provide a fundamental unifying\nmodeling tool for statistical mechanics, probabilistic machine learning, and\nartificial intelligence. Typically MRFs are complex and high-dimensional with\nnodes and edges (connections) built in a modular fashion from simpler,\nlow-dimensional probabilistic models and their local connections; in turn, this\nmodularity allows to incorporate available data to MRFs and efficiently\nsimulate them by leveraging their graph-theoretic structure. Learning graphical\nmodels from data and/or constructing them from physical modeling and\nconstraints necessarily involves uncertainties inherited from data, modeling\nchoices, or numerical approximations. These uncertainties in the MRF can be\nmanifested either in the graph structure or the probability distribution\nfunctions, and necessarily will propagate in predictions for quantities of\ninterest. Here we quantify such uncertainties using tight, information based\nbounds on the predictions of quantities of interest; these bounds take\nadvantage of the graphical structure of MRFs and are capable of handling the\ninherent high-dimensionality of such graphical models. We demonstrate our\nmethods in MRFs for medical diagnostics and statistical mechanics models. In\nthe latter, we develop uncertainty quantification bounds for finite size\neffects and phase diagrams, which constitute two of the typical predictions\ngoals of statistical mechanics modeling.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Aug 2020 18:07:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 20 Oct 2020 02:18:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 17 Jul 2021 04:35:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-20", "authors_parsed": [["Birmpa", "Panagiota", ""], ["Katsoulakis", "Markos A.", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.00105", "submitter": "Manal Eltanab", "authors": "Manal El Tanab and Walaa Hamouda", "title": "Fast Grant Learning-Based Approach for Machine Type Communications with\n  NOMA", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.LG math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we propose a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based\ncommunication framework that allows machine type devices (MTDs) to access the\nnetwork while avoiding congestion.

Then, we establish a novel mathematical\nmodel that reflects the impacts of natural, relative smoothness-enabled and\ntranscoding-enabled multicast opportunities on the average transmission energy\nand transcoding energy. Based on this model, we optimize the transmission\nresource allocation, playback quality level selection and transmission quality\nlevel selection to minimize the energy consumption in the four cases with\ndifferent requirements for quality variation and video playback modes. By\ncomparing the optimal values in the four cases, we prove that the energy\nconsumption reduces when more multicast opportunities can be utilized.

Our results suggest that lsNGC captures\nmeaningful interactions from limited observational data, where it performs\nfavorably when compared to traditionally used methods. Finally, we demonstrate\nthe applicability of lsNGC to estimating causality in large, real-world systems\nby inferring directional nonlinear, multivariate causal relationships among a\nlarge number of relatively short time-series acquired from functional Magnetic\nResonance Imaging (fMRI) data of the human brain.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Sep 2020 06:27:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-11", "authors_parsed": [["Wism\u00fcller", "Axel", ""], ["DSouza", "Adora M.", ""], ["Abidin", "Anas Z.", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.04723", "submitter": "Emil Bj\\\"ornson", "authors": "Emil Bj\\\"ornson and Luca Sanguinetti", "title": "Rayleigh Fading Modeling and Channel Hardening for Reconfigurable\n  Intelligent Surfaces", "comments": "Published in IEEE Wireless Communications Letters, 6 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/LWC.2020.3046107", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT eess.SP math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A realistic performance assessment of any wireless technology requires the\nuse of a channel model that reflects its main characteristics.

When\nstudying the optimal transmission rates achievable with asymptotically\nvanishing error it is usually assumed that these circuits can be implemented\nusing noise-free gates. While this assumption is satisfied for classical\nmachines in many scenarios, it is not expected to be satisfied in the near term\nfuture for quantum machines where decoherence leads to faults in the quantum\ngates. As a result, fundamental questions regarding the practical relevance of\nquantum channel coding remain open. By combining techniques from fault-tolerant\nquantum computation with techniques from quantum communication, we initiate the\nstudy of these questions. We introduce fault-tolerant versions of quantum\ncapacities quantifying the optimal communication rates achievable with\nasymptotically vanishing total error when the encoding and decoding circuits\nare affected by gate errors with small probability. Our main results are\nthreshold theorems for the classical and quantum capacity: For every quantum\nchannel $T$ and every $\\epsilon>0$ there exists a threshold $p(\\epsilon,T)$ for\nthe gate error probability below which rates larger than $C-\\epsilon$ are\nfault-tolerantly achievable with vanishing overall communication error, where\n$C$ denotes the usual capacity.

Our findings showcase that there exists an optimal number\nof virtual machines for parallel computing at the MEC server to maximize the\ntask execution capacity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Sep 2020 16:25:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-17", "authors_parsed": [["Emara", "Mustafa", ""], ["ElSawy", "Hesham", ""], ["Filippou", "Miltiades C.", ""], ["Bauch", "Gerhard", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.07811", "submitter": "Bilgesu Bilgin", "authors": "Bilgesu Arif Bilgin, Phillip Stanley-Marbell", "title": "Probabilistic Value-Deviation-Bounded Source-Dependent Bit-Level Channel\n  Adaptation for Approximate Communication", "comments": "14 pages, 10 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Computers", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "eess.SP cs.AR cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Computing systems that can tolerate effects of errors in their communicated\ndata values can trade this tolerance for improved resource efficiency. Many\nimportant applications of computing, such as embedded sensor systems, can\ntolerate errors that are bounded in their distribution of deviation from\ncorrectness (distortion). We present a channel adaptation technique which\nmodulates properties of I/O channels typical in embedded sensor systems, to\nprovide a tradeoff between I/O power dissipation and distortion of communicated\ndata. We provide an efficient-to-compute formulation for the distribution of\ninteger distortion accounting for the distribution of transmitted values.

The key idea is to model the\ninterference variation as a discrete state space discrete-time Markov chain.\nThe state transition probability matrix is then used to estimate the state\nevolution in time, and allocate radio resources accordingly. The proposed\nscheme is found to meet the target reliability requirements in a low-latency\nsingle-shot transmission system considering realistic system assumptions, while\nrequiring only ~25% more resources than the optimum case with perfect\ninterference knowledge.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Sep 2020 15:21:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-22", "authors_parsed": [["Mahmood", "Nurul Huda", ""], ["Lopez", "Onel Alcaraz", ""], ["Alves", "Hirley", ""], ["Latva-aho", "Matti", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.09967", "submitter": "Hwanjin Kim", "authors": "Hwanjin Kim, Sucheol Kim, Hyeongtaek Lee, Chulhee Jang, Yongyun Choi,\n  and Junil Choi", "title": "Massive MIMO Channel Prediction: Kalman Filtering vs. Machine Learning", "comments": "Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Communications", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.LG math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper focuses on channel prediction techniques for massive\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.

However, existing secure aggregation protocols\nincur high computation/communication costs, especially when the number of model\nparameters is larger than the number of clients participating in an iteration\n-- a typical scenario in federated learning.\n  In this paper, we propose a secure aggregation protocol, FastSecAgg, that is\nefficient in terms of computation and communication, and robust to client\ndropouts.
