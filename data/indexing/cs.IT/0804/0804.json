It is assumed that every node in the\nnetwork has its own power constraint. A two-step amplify-and-forward protocol\nis used, in which the transmitter and relays not only use match filters to form\na beam at the receiver but also adaptively adjust their transmit powers\naccording to the channel strength information. For a network with any number of\nrelays and no direct link, the optimal power control is solved analytically.\nThe complexity of finding the exact solution is linear in the number of relays.\nOur results show that the transmitter should always use its maximal power and\nthe optimal power used at a relay is not a binary function. It can take any\nvalue between zero and its maximum transmit power. Also, this value depends on\nthe quality of all other channels in addition to the relay's own channels.\nDespite this coupling fact, distributive strategies are proposed in which, with\nthe aid of a low-rate broadcast from the receiver, a relay needs only its own\nchannel information to implement the optimal power control. Simulated\nperformance shows that network beamforming achieves the maximal diversity and\noutperforms other existing schemes. Then, beamforming in networks with a direct\nlink are considered. We show that when the direct link exists during the first\nstep only, the optimal power control is the same as that of networks with no\ndirect link. For networks with a direct link during the second step, recursive\nnumerical algorithms are proposed to solve the power control problem.\nSimulation shows that by adjusting the transmitter and relays' powers\nadaptively, network performance is significantly improved.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Apr 2008 19:44:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-04-08", "authors_parsed": [["Jing", "Y.", ""], ["Jafarkhani", "H.", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.1172", "submitter": "Jaspreet Singh", "authors": "Jaspreet Singh, Onkar Dabeer, Upamanyu Madhow", "title": "Transceiver Design with Low-Precision Analog-to-Digital Conversion : An\n  Information-Theoretic Perspective", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Modern communication receiver architectures center around digital signal\nprocessing (DSP), with the bulk of the receiver processing being performed on\ndigital signals obtained after analog-to-digital conversion (ADC).

Thereby, the BS can acquire the long-term\nchannel-distribution information (CDI) for each MT. This paper extends the\nwell-known transmit-covariance feedback scheme for the point-to-point fading\nMIMO channel to the fading MIMO-MAC, whereby the BS jointly optimizes the\ntransmit signal covariance matrices for all MTs based on their CDI, and then\nsends each transmit covariance matrix back to the corresponding MT via a\nfeedback channel.

The senders in an IFC communicate with their own receiver (unicast)\nwhile those in a C-MAC communicate with both receivers (multicast). The\ninstantaneous fading state between every transmit-receive pair in this network\nis assumed to be known at all transmitters and receivers. Under an average\npower constraint at each source, the sum-capacity of the C-MAC and the power\npolicy that achieves this capacity is developed. The conditions defining the\nclasses of strong and very strong ergodic IFCs are presented and the multicast\nsum-capacity is shown to be tight for both classes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Apr 2008 16:51:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Sankar", "Lalitha", ""], ["Erkip", "Elza", ""], ["Poor", "H.
