However, when precoding techniques are\nutilized to obtain multi-antenna gains, the system generally requires channel\nstate information (CSI) at the transmitters. We consider a linear precoding\nscheme in a MIMO relaying broadcast channel with quantized CSI feedback from\nboth two-hop links. With this scheme, each remote user feeds back its quantized\nCSI to the relay, and the relay sends back the quantized precoding information\nto the base station (BS). An upper bound on the rate loss due to quantized\nchannel knowledge is first characterized. Then, in order to maintain the rate\nloss within a predetermined gap for growing SNRs, a strategy of scaling\nquantization quality of both two-hop links is proposed. It is revealed that the\nnumbers of feedback bits of both links should scale linearly with the transmit\npower at the relay, while only the bit number of feedback from the relay to the\nBS needs to grow with the increasing transmit power at the BS. Numerical\nresults are provided to verify the proposed strategy for feedback quality\ncontrol.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 May 2012 08:10:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Wei", ""], ["Dong", "Xiaodai", ""], ["Lu", "Wu-Sheng", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.2590", "submitter": "Eirik Rosnes", "authors": "Eirik Rosnes, Marcel A.

Historically, reconciliation has been\nmainly done using close to minimal information disclosure but heavily\ninteractive procedures, like Cascade, or using less efficient but also less\ninteractive -just one message is exchanged- procedures, like the ones based in\nlow-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. The price to pay in the LDPC case is\nthat good efficiency is only attained for very long codes and in a very narrow\nrange centered around the quantum bit error rate (QBER) that the code was\ndesigned to reconcile, thus forcing to have several codes if a broad range of\nQBER needs to be catered for. Real world implementations of these methods are\nthus very demanding, either on computational or communication resources or\nboth, to the extent that the last generation of GHz clocked QKD systems are\nfinding a bottleneck in the classical part. In order to produce compact, high\nperformance and reliable QKD systems it would be highly desirable to remove\nthese problems. Here we analyse the use of short-length LDPC codes in the\ninformation reconciliation context using a low interactivity, blind, protocol\nthat avoids an a priori error rate estimation. We demonstrate that 2x10^3 bits\nlength LDPC codes are suitable for blind reconciliation. Such codes are of high\ninterest in practice, since they can be used for hardware implementations with\nvery high throughput.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 May 2012 15:27:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 29 Jan 2013 07:18:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-30", "authors_parsed": [["Martinez-Mateo", "Jesus", ""], ["Elkouss", "David", ""], ["Martin", "Vicente", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.5823", "submitter": "Hector Zenil", "authors": "Roger Penrose", "title": "Foreword: A Computable Universe, Understanding Computation and Exploring\n  Nature As Computation", "comments": "26 pages, foreword to the book A Computable Universe: Understanding\n  Computation and Exploring Nature As Computation, World Scientific, 2012\n  http://www.mathrix.org/experimentalAIT/ComputationNature.htm", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GL cs.AI cs.CC cs.IT math.IT physics.hist-ph physics.pop-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  I am most honoured to have the privilege to present the Foreword to this\nfascinating and wonderfully varied collection of contributions, concerning the\nnature of computation and of its deep connection with the operation of those\nbasic laws, known or yet unknown, governing the universe in which we live.\nFundamentally deep questions are indeed being grappled with here, and the fact\nthat we find so many different viewpoints is something to be expected, since,\nin truth, we know little about the foundational nature and origins of these\nbasic laws, despite the immense precision that we so often find revealed in\nthem.

Under the conventional single-cell\nsetup, RBF is known to achieve the optimal sum-capacity scaling law as the\nnumber of users goes to infinity, thanks to the multiuser diversity enabled\ntransmission scheduling that virtually eliminates the intra-cell interference.\nIn this paper, we extend the study of RBF to a more practical multi-cell\ndownlink system with single-antenna receivers subject to the additional\ninter-cell interference (ICI). First, we consider the case of finite\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at each receiver. We derive a closed-form\nexpression of the achievable sum-rate with the multi-cell RBF, based upon which\nwe show an asymptotic sum-rate scaling law as the number of users goes to\ninfinity. Next, we consider the high-SNR regime and for tractable analysis\nassume that the number of users in each cell scales in a certain order with the\nper-cell SNR. Under this setup, we characterize the achievable degrees of\nfreedom (DoF) for the single-cell case with RBF. Then we extend the analysis to\nthe multi-cell RBF case by characterizing the DoF region. It is shown that the\nDoF region characterization provides useful guideline on how to design a\ncooperative multi-cell RBF system to achieve optimal throughput tradeoffs among\ndifferent cells. Furthermore, our results reveal that the multi-cell RBF scheme\nachieves the \"interference-free DoF\" region upper bound for the multi-cell\nsystem, provided that the per-cell number of users has a sufficiently large\nscaling order with the SNR. Our result thus confirms the optimality of\nmulti-cell RBF in this regime even without the complete CSI at the transmitter,\nas compared to other full-CSI requiring transmission schemes such as\ninterference alignment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 May 2012 02:56:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 02:50:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 9 May 2013 01:59:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Nguyen", "Hieu Duy", ""], ["Zhang", "Rui", ""], ["Hui", "Hon Tat", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.5856", "submitter": "Alexei Kaltchenko", "authors": "Evgeniy Timofeev and Alexei Kaltchenko", "title": "Nearest-neighbor Entropy Estimators with Weak Metrics", "comments": "9 pages, no figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A problem of improving the accuracy of nonparametric entropy estimation for a\nstationary ergodic process is considered.

The\nmost recent result in this direction shows that uniform algebraic gossip\ndisseminates k messages in O({\\Delta}(D + k + log n)) rounds where D is the\ndiameter, n the size of the network and {\\Delta} the maximum degree.\n  In this paper we give a simpler, short and self-contained proof for this\nworst-case guarantee. Our approach also allows to reduce the quadratic\n{\\Delta}D term to min{3n, {\\Delta}D}. We furthermore show that a simple round\nrobin routing scheme also achieves min{3n, {\\Delta}D} + {\\Delta}k rounds,\neliminating both randomization and coding. Lastly, we combine a recent\nnon-uniform gossip algorithm with a simple routing scheme to get a O(D + k +\nlog^{O(1)}) gossip information dissemination algorithm. This is order optimal\nas long as D and k are not both polylogarithmically small.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 May 2012 11:30:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Haeupler", "Bernhard", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.6974", "submitter": "Vinith Misra", "authors": "Vinith Misra and Tsachy Weissman", "title": "The Porosity of Additive Noise Sequences", "comments": "22 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Consider a binary additive noise channel with noiseless feedback.
