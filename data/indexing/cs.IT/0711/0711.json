The channels we consider can have a finite number of states, such\nas partial response channels, or they can have an infinite state-space, such as\ntime-varying fading channels. We optimize recently-proposed information rate\nbounds for such channels, which make use of auxiliary finite-state machine\nchannels (FSMCs). Our main contribution in this paper is to provide iterative\nexpectation-maximization (EM) type algorithms to optimize the parameters of the\nauxiliary FSMC to tighten these bounds. We provide an explicit, iterative\nalgorithm that improves the upper bound at each iteration. We also provide an\neffective method for iteratively optimizing the lower bound. To demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our algorithms, we provide several examples of partial\nresponse and fading channels, where the proposed optimization techniques\nsignificantly tighten the initial upper and lower bounds. Finally, we compare\nour results with an improved variation of the \\emph{simplex} local optimization\nalgorithm, called \\emph{Soblex}. This comparison shows that our proposed\nalgorithms are superior to the Soblex method, both in terms of robustness in\nfinding the tightest bounds and in computational efficiency. Interestingly,\nfrom a channel coding/decoding perspective, optimizing the lower bound is\nrelated to increasing the achievable mismatched information rate, i.e., the\ninformation rate of a communication system where the decoder at the receiver is\nmatched to the auxiliary channel, and not to the original channel.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Nov 2007 02:16:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Sadeghi", "Parastoo", ""], ["Vontobel", "Pascal O.", ""], ["Shams", "Ramtin", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.4414", "submitter": "Rui Zhang", "authors": "Rui Zhang, and Ying Chang Liang", "title": "Exploiting Multi-Antennas for Opportunistic Spectrum Sharing in\n  Cognitive Radio Networks", "comments": "Extension of IEEE PIMRC 2007. 35 pages, 6 figures.

The representation can exploit any\ncomputable regularity in objects to compactly describe them, while also being\ncapable of representing random objects as raw data. A set of rules uniformly\ndictates the interpretation of the representation into raw signal, which makes\nit possible to ask what pattern a given raw signal contains. Also, it allows\nsimple separation of the information that we wish to ignore from that which we\nmeasure, by using a set of maps to delineate the a priori parts of the objects,\nleaving only the information in the structure.\n  Using the representation, we introduce a measure of information in general\nobjects relative to structures defined by the set of maps. We point out that\nthe common prescription of encoding objects by strings to use Kolmogorov\ncomplexity is meaningless when, as often is the case, the encoding is not\nspecified in any way other than that it exists. Noting this, we define the\nmeasure directly in terms of the structures of the spaces in which the objects\nreside. As a result, the measure is defined relative to a set of maps that\ncharacterize the structures. It turns out that the measure is equivalent to\nKolmogorov complexity when it is defined relative to the maps characterizing\nthe structure of natural numbers.
