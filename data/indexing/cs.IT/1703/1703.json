In the\nnon-coherent case, the SU relay forwards the signal from the SU source without\nregulating the phase; while in the coherent scenario, the SU relay regulates\nthe phase when forwarding the signal to minimize the interference at the\nprimary-user (PU) receiver. We consider the problem of maximizing the\ntransmission rate from the SU source to the SU destination subject to the\ninterference constraint at the PU receiver and power constraints at both the SU\nsource and SU relay. We then develop a mathematical model to analyze the data\nrate performance of the FDCRN considering the self-interference effects at the\nFD relay. We develop low-complexity and high-performance joint power control\nand relay selection algorithms. Extensive numerical results are presented to\nillustrate the impacts of power level parameters and the self-interference\ncancellation quality on the rate performance.

Generally rate can be measured to the\ntransmission in the peak traffic times, i.e., this efficiency increases with\nthe decreasing of rate. In order to implement a coded caching scheme, each file\nin the library must be split in a certain number of packets. And this number\ndirectly reflects the complexity of a coded caching scheme, i.e., the\ncomplexity increases with the increasing of the packet number. However there\nexists a tradeoff between the rate and packet number. So it is meaningful to\ncharacterize this tradeoff and design the related Pareto-optimal coded caching\nschemes with respect to both parameters.\n  Recently, a new concept called placement delivery array (PDA) was proposed to\ncharacterize the coded caching scheme. However as far as we know no one has yet\nproved that one of the previously known PDAs is Pareto-optimal. In this paper,\nwe first derive two lower bounds on the rate under the framework of PDA.\nConsequently, the PDA proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen is Pareto-optimal, and\na tradeoff between rate and packet number is obtained for some parameters.\nThen, from the above observations and the view point of combinatorial design,\ntwo new classes of Pareto-optimal PDAs are obtained. Based on these PDAs, the\nschemes with low rate and packet number are obtained. Finally the performance\nof some previously known PDAs are estimated by comparing with these two classes\nof schemes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 5 Mar 2017 03:00:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 10 Apr 2017 07:59:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 2 Oct 2017 07:34:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Cheng", "Minquan", ""], ["Yan", "Qifa", ""], ["Tang", "Xiaohu", ""], ["Jiang", "Jing", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.01562", "submitter": "Sergey Zhidkov", "authors": "Sergey V.

In order to capture the VR users' quality-of-service (QoS) in SCNs, a\nnovel VR model, based on multi-attribute utility theory, is proposed. This\nmodel jointly accounts for VR metrics such as tracking accuracy, processing\ndelay, and transmission delay. In this model, the small base stations (SBSs)\nact as the VR control centers that collect the tracking information from VR\nusers over the cellular uplink. Once this information is collected, the SBSs\nwill then send the three dimensional images and accompanying surround stereo\naudio to the VR users over the downlink. Therefore, the resource allocation\nproblem in VR wireless networks must jointly consider both the uplink and\ndownlink. This problem is then formulated as a noncooperative game and a\ndistributed algorithm based on the machine learning framework of echo state\nnetworks (ESNs) is proposed to find the solution of this game. The use of the\nproposed ESN algorithm enables the SBSs to predict the VR QoS of each SBS and\nguarantees the convergence to a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. The analytical\nresult shows that each user's VR QoS jointly depends on both VR tracking\naccuracy and wireless resource allocation.

The joint optimization problem is modeled\nas a mixed binary integer programming problem subject to exclusive sub-carrier\nallocation and separate power budget constraints at each node. A joint\noptimization solution is obtained through Lagrangian dual decomposition where\nKKT conditions are exploited to find the optimal power allocation at base\nstation. Further, to reduce the complexity, a sub-optimal scheme is presented\nwhere the optimal power allocation is derived under fixed sub-carrier-relay\nassignment.

The bin index is used by\nthe encoder and the relay to choose the cooperation codeword in the next\ntransmission block. In causal settings the cooperation is independent of the\nstate. In \\emph{non-causal} settings dependency between the relay's\ntransmission and the state can increase the transmission rates. The encoder\nimplicitly conveys partial state information to the relay. In particular, it\nuses the states of the next block and selects a cooperation codeword\naccordingly and the relay transmission depends on the cooperation codeword and\ntherefore also on the states. We also consider the multiple access channel with\npartial cribbing as a semi-deterministic channel. The capacity region of this\nchannel with non-causal CSI is achieved by the new scheme. Examining the result\nin several cases, we introduce a new problem of a point-to-point (PTP) channel\nwhere the state is provided to the transmitter by a state encoder.\nInterestingly, even though the CSI is also available at the receiver, we\nprovide an example which shows that the capacity with non-causal CSI at the\nstate encoder is strictly larger than the capacity with causal CSI.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Mar 2017 15:15:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 2 Apr 2017 10:55:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Gattegno", "Ido B.", ""], ["Permuter", "Haim H.", ""], ["Shamai", "Shlomo", ""], ["\u00d6zg\u00fcr", "Ayfer", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.08127", "submitter": "Abu Bakar Siddique", "authors": "Abu Bakar Siddique", "title": "Combinatorial Entropy Encoding", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper proposes a novel entropy encoding technique for lossless data\ncompression.

Following the evolution of a news-story is a difficult task given\nthat there is no such mechanism available to track back in time to study the\ndiffusion of the relevant events in digital news feeds. The techniques\ndeveloped so far to extract meaningful information from a massive corpus rely\non similarity search, which results in a myopic loopback to the same topic\nwithout providing the needed insights to hypothesize the origin of a story that\nmay be completely different than the news today. In this paper, we present an\nalgorithm that mines historical data to detect the origin of an event, segments\nthe timeline into disjoint groups of coherent news articles, and outlines the\nmost important documents in a timeline with a soft probability to provide a\nbetter understanding of the evolution of a story. Qualitative and quantitative\napproaches to evaluate our framework demonstrate that our algorithm discovers\nstatistically significant and meaningful stories in reasonable time.\nAdditionally, a relevant case study on a set of news articles demonstrates that\nthe generated output of the algorithm holds the promise to aid prediction of\nfuture entities in a story.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Mar 2017 20:52:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 21 Dec 2017 15:46:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-22", "authors_parsed": [["Barranco", "Roberto Camacho", ""], ["Boedihardjo", "Arnold P.", ""], ["Hossain", "M.

To deploy many\nantennas in reasonable form factors, base stations are expected to employ\nantenna arrays in both horizontal and vertical dimensions, which is known as\nfull-dimension (FD) MIMO. The most popular two-dimensional array is the uniform\nplanar array (UPA), where antennas are placed in a grid pattern.
