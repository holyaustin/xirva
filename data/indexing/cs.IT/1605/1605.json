A critical step in replicating the self-interference is the estimation\nof the multi-path channel through which the transmitted signal propagates to\nthe antenna. Since there is no prior model on the number of multipath\nreflections, current techniques assume a tap delay line filter (in the RF and\ndigital domain) with a large number of taps, and estimate the taps in the\nanalog and the digital domain. Assuming such a model leads to a large\nform-factor for the analog and RF circuits and increased complexity in the\ndigital domain.\n  In this paper, using a linearization technique, we show that the\nself-interference channel in an indoor environment can be effectively modelled\nas $H(f)=C_0 + C_1f$ in the frequency domain. Thus, the effective\nself-interference channel can be represented by two parameters $C_0$ and $C_1$,\nirrespective of the multipath environment. We also provide experimental\nevidence to verify the above channel model and propose novel low-complexity\ndesigns for self-interference cancellation. Linearization not only aids in the\npracticality of analog cancellation by reducing the form factor, but also\nresults in a simpler SI filter model in the digital domain due to\ndimensionality reduction of the channel parameters.

When a large-scale\nantenna array (which is also called massive MIMO) is equipped in a\nbase-station, or a large number of distributed antennas (which is also called\nlarge-scale distributed MIMO) are deployed, the spectral and energy\nefficiencies can be further improved by using spatial domain multiple access.\nThis paper provides an overview of massive MIMO and large-scale distributed\nMIMO systems, including spectral efficiency analysis, channel state information\n(CSI) acquisition, wireless transmission technology, and resource allocation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 May 2016 13:14:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-12", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Dongming", ""], ["Zhang", "Yu", ""], ["Wei", "Hao", ""], ["You", "Xiaohu", ""], ["Gao", "Xiqi", ""], ["Wang", "Jiangzhou", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.03449", "submitter": "Atsushi Iwasaki", "authors": "Atsushi Iwasaki, Ken Umeno", "title": "One-stroke polynomials over a ring of modulo $2^w$", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Permutation polynomials over a ring of modulo $2^w$ are compatible with\ndigital computers and digital signal processors, and so they are in particular\nexpected to be useful for cryptography and pseudo random number generator.

The specification and assignment of these orthogonal sets to a regular\ntessellation of hexagonal cells have been solved regardless of the parity and\nsize of $m$ (where $2^m$ is the length of the codewords). In particular, when\nthe re-use distance is $D=4$ the number of users per cell is $2^{m-2}$ for\nalmost all $m$, which is twice as many as can be obtained by the best known\nmethods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 May 2016 18:09:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-18", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "WeiGuo", ""], ["Xie", "ChunLei", ""], ["Pasalic", "Enes", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.05281", "submitter": "Evyatar Hemo", "authors": "Evyatar Hemo and Yuval Cassuto", "title": "$d$-imbalance WOM Codes for Reduced Inter-Cell Interference in\n  Multi-Level NVMs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In recent years, due to the spread of multi-level non-volatile memories\n(NVM), $q$-ary write-once memories (WOM) codes have been extensively studied.\nBy using WOM codes, it is possible to rewrite NVMs $t$ times before erasing the\ncells.

It is assumed\nthat the transmitters have access to synergistic alternating channel state\ninformation (CSI). Specifically, the CSIT alternates between three states,\nnamely, perfect, delayed and no-CSIT, in a certain manner to enable these\nstates to work together cooperatively. These states are associated with\nfractions of time denoted by $\\lambda_P$, $\\lambda_D$ \\text{and} $\\lambda_N$,\nrespectively. For the two-user $X$-channel, simple upper bound is developed to\nprove the tightness of the achievability result of $4/3$ DoF under a certain\ndistribution of the availability of three CSIT states for\n$\\Lambda(\\lambda_P=1/3, \\lambda_D= 1/3, \\lambda_N=1/3)$.

Also, this lower bound is strictly better than the best lower bound\nknown for the case of delayed CSI assumption for all values of $K$.

Numerical results are used to validate the asymptotic analysis in\nthe finite system regime and to show that the proposed TPE transceivers\nefficiently mimic the optimal ones, while requiring much lower computational\ncomplexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 May 2016 14:35:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 8 Feb 2017 13:45:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["Sifaou", "Houssem", ""], ["Kammoun", "Abla", ""], ["Sanguinetti", "Luca", ""], ["Debbah", "M\u00e9rouane", ""], ["Alouini", "Mohamed-Slim", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.07495", "submitter": "Tianxian Zhang", "authors": "Yichuan Yang, Tianxian Zhang, Wei Yi, Lingjiang Kong, Xiaolong Li,\n  Bing Wang, Xiaobo Yang", "title": "Optimal Deployment of Multistatic Radar System Using Multi-Objective\n  Particle Swarm Optimization", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  We consider an optimization deployment problem of multistatic radar system\n(MSRS).

With these results, we believe our design guideline can inspire\na new generation of Wi-Fi MAC protocols that fully embody and scale the FD\ncapacity gain.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 May 2016 13:27:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-13", "authors_parsed": [["Queiroz", "Saulo", ""], ["Vilela", "Jo\u00e3o", ""], ["Hexsel", "Roberto", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.09715", "submitter": "Alireza Sadeghi", "authors": "Alireza Sadeghi, Michele Zorzi, and Farshad Lahouti", "title": "Analysis of Key Generation Rate from Wireless Channel in In-Band\n  Full-Duplex Communications", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICCW.2016.7503772", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, the impact of in-band full-duplex (IBFD) wireless\ncommunications on secret key generation via physical layer channel state\ninformation is investigated. A key generation strategy for IBFD wireless\ndevices to increase the rate of generated secret keys over multipath fading\nchannels is proposed. Conventionally, due to the half-duplex (HD) constraint on\nwireless transmissions, sensing simultaneous reciprocal channel measurements is\nnot possible, which leads to a degraded key generation rate. However, with the\nadvent of IBFD wireless devices, the legitimate nodes can sense the shared\nwireless link simultaneously at the possible cost of a self-interference (SI)\nchannel estimation and some residual self-interference (RSI). As we\ndemonstrate, with HD correlated observations the key rate is upper bounded by a\nconstant, while with IBFD the key rate is only limited by the SI cancellation\nperformance and is in general greater than that of its HD counterpart. Our\nanalysis shows that with reasonable levels of SI cancellation, in the high SNR\nregime the key rate of IBFD is much higher, while in low SNRs, the HD system\nperforms better. Finally, the key rate loss due to the overhead imposed by the\nSI channel estimation phase is discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 May 2016 17:07:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-06", "authors_parsed": [["Sadeghi", "Alireza", ""], ["Zorzi", "Michele", ""], ["Lahouti", "Farshad", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.09716", "submitter": "Alireza Sadeghi", "authors": "Michele Luvisotto, Alireza Sadeghi, Farshad Lahouti, Stefano Vitturi,\n  Michele Zorzi", "title": "RCFD: A Frequency Based Channel Access Scheme for Full Duplex Wireless\n  Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recently, several working implementations of in--band full--duplex wireless\nsystems have been presented, where the same node can transmit and receive\nsimultaneously in the same frequency band.
