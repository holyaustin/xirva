This paper investigates the challenge of\nmodelling and expressing structures and processes in legislation and the law by\nusing visual modelling and information visualisation (InfoVis) to assist\naccessibility of legal knowledge, practice and knowledge formalisation as a\nbasis for legal AI. The paper uses a subset of the well-defined Unified\nModelling Language (UML) to visually express the structure and process of the\nlegislation and the law to create visual flow diagrams called lawmaps, which\nform the basis of further formalisation. A lawmap development methodology is\npresented and evaluated by creating a set of lawmaps for the practice of\nconveyancing and the Landlords and Tenants Act 1954 of the United Kingdom. This\npaper is the first of a new breed of preliminary solutions capable of\napplication across all aspects, from legislation to practice; and capable of\naccelerating development of legal AI.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Nov 2020 18:36:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["McLachlan", "Scott", ""], ["Kyrimi", "Evangelia", ""], ["Dube", "Kudakwashe", ""], ["Fenton", "Norman", ""], ["Webley", "Lisa", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.00629", "submitter": "Lek-Heng Lim", "authors": "Yuhang Cai and Lek-Heng Lim", "title": "Distances between probability distributions of different dimensions", "comments": "20 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST cs.IT math.IT math.PR stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Comparing probability distributions is an indispensable and ubiquitous task\nin machine learning and statistics.

An AG code $C = C(\\mathcal{C}, \\mathcal{P}, D)$ is a\nvector space associated to evaluations on $\\mathcal{P}$ of functions in the\nRiemann-Roch space $L_\\mathcal{C}(D)$. The problem of testing proximity to an\nerror-correcting code $C$ consists in distinguishing between the case where an\ninput word, given as an oracle, belongs to $C$ and the one where it is far from\nevery codeword of $C$. AG codes are good candidates to construct short proof\nsystems, but there exists no efficient proximity tests for them. We aim to fill\nthis gap.\n  We construct an Interactive Oracle Proof of Proximity (IOPP) for some\nfamilies of AG codes by generalizing an IOPP for Reed-Solomon codes introduced\nby Ben-Sasson, Bentov, Horesh and Riabzev, known as the FRI protocol. We\nidentify suitable requirements for designing efficient IOPP systems for AG\ncodes. Our approach relies on Kani's result that splits the Riemann-Roch space\nof any invariant divisor under a group action on a curve into several explicit\nRiemann-Roch spaces on the quotient curve. Under some hypotheses, a proximity\ntest to $C$ can thus be reduced to one to a simpler code $C'$. Iterating this\nprocess thoroughly, we end up with a membership test to a code with\nsignificantly smaller length. In addition to proposing the first proximity test\ntargeting AG codes, our IOPP admits quasilinear prover arithmetic complexity\nand sublinear verifier arithmetic complexity with constant soundness for\nmeaningful classes of AG codes.

These\napplications raised the interest of the community for theoretical properties of\nthis type of codes, such as the hardness of decoding in rank metric. Among\nclassical problems associated to codes for a given metric, the notion of code\nequivalence (to decide if two codes are isometric) has always been of the\ngreatest interest, for its cryptographic applications or its deep connexions to\nthe graph isomorphism problem.\n  In this article, we discuss the hardness of the code equivalence problem in\nrank metric for $\\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$-linear and general rank metric codes. In the\n$\\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$-linear case, we reduce the underlying problem to another one\ncalled {\\em Matrix Codes Right Equivalence Problem}. We prove the latter\nproblem to be either in $\\mathcal{P}$ or in $\\mathcal{ZPP}$ depending of the\nground field size. This is obtained by designing an algorithm whose principal\nroutines are linear algebra and factoring polynomials over finite fields. It\nturns out that the most difficult instances involve codes with non trivial {\\em\nstabilizer algebras}. The resolution of the latter case will involve tools\nrelated to finite dimensional algebras and Wedderburn--Artin theory. It is\ninteresting to note that 30 years ago, an important trend in theoretical\ncomputer science consisted to design algorithms making effective major results\nof this theory. These algorithmic results turn out to be particularly useful in\nthe present article.\n  Finally, for general matrix codes, we prove that the equivalence problem\n(both left and right) is at least as hard as the well--studied {\\em Monomial\nEquivalence Problem} for codes endowed with the Hamming metric.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Nov 2020 18:14:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 10 Jun 2021 13:38:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Couvreur", "Alain", ""], ["Debris-Alazard", "Thomas", ""], ["Gaborit", "Philippe", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.04645", "submitter": "Mil\\'an Mosonyi", "authors": "Mil\\'an Mosonyi, Zsombor Szil\\'agyi, Mih\\'aly Weiner", "title": "On the error exponents of binary state discrimination with composite\n  hypotheses", "comments": "50 pages. v2: Considerably expanded, also includes the discussion of\n  the strong converse exponent.

In\nparticular, an inner bound is obtained for the $K$-receiver discrete memoryless\n(DM) BC for the diamond message set which consists of four groupcast messages:\none desired by all receivers, one by all but two receivers, and two more\ndesired by all but each one of those two receivers. The inner bound is based on\nrate-splitting and superposition coding and is given in explicit form herein as\na union over coding distributions of four-dimensional polytopes.

This inner\nbound consists of inequalities which are then identified to be within the class\nof a plethora of (indeed, infinitely many) generalized cut-set outer bounds\nrecently obtained by Salimi et al for broadcast networks.

In this work, we focus on a certain channel model known as the\ndelay-doppler channel. This model begins to be useful in the high frequency\ncarrier setting, which is increasingly common with developments in\nmillimeter-wave technology. Moreover, the delay-doppler model then continues to\nbe applicable even when using signals of large bandwidth, which is a standard\napproach to achieving high resolution channel estimation. However, when high\nresolution is desirable, this standard approach results in a tension with the\ndesire for efficiency because, in particular, it immediately implies that the\nsignals in play live in a space of very high dimension $N$ (e.g., ~$10^6$ in\nsome applications), as per the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem.\n  To address this difficulty, we propose a novel randomized estimation scheme\ncalled Sparse Channel Estimation, or SCE for short, for channel estimation in\nthe $k$-sparse setting (e.g., $k$ objects in radar detection). This scheme\ninvolves an estimation procedure with sampling and space complexity both on the\norder of $k(logN)^3$, and arithmetic complexity on the order of $k(log N)^3 +\nk^2$, for $N$ sufficiently large.\n  To the best of our knowledge, Sparse Channel Estimation (SCE) is the first of\nits kind to achieve these complexities simultaneously -- it seems to be\nextremely efficient!

As MIMO ML enters the so-called low $\\alpha$\nregime (fat system matrix with ratio of the number of rows and columns,\n$\\alpha$, going well below $1$) it becomes increasingly difficult even for the\nbasic standard CLuP to handle it. However, the discovery of the rephasing\nensures that CLuP remains on track and preserves its ability to achieve the ML\nperformance. To demonstrate the power of the rephasing we also conducted quite\na few numerical experiments, compared the results we obtained through them to\nthe theoretical predictions, and observed an excellent agreement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Nov 2020 16:36:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-24", "authors_parsed": [["Stojnic", "Mihailo", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.11550", "submitter": "Mihailo Stojnic", "authors": "Mihailo Stojnic", "title": "Sparse linear regression -- CLuP achieves the ideal \\emph{exact} ML", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we revisit one of the classical statistical problems, the\nso-called sparse maximum-likelihood (ML) linear regression.
