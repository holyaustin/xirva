In this paper we propose a new\nscheme for reconstructing multiband sparse signals using a small number of\nsampling channels. The scheme, which we call synchronous multirate sampling\n(SMRS), entails gathering samples synchronously at few different rates whose\nsum is significantly lower than the Nyquist sampling rate. The signals are\nreconstructed by solving a system of linear equations. We have demonstrated an\naccurate and robust reconstruction of signals using a small number of sampling\nchannels that operate at relatively high rates. Sampling at higher rates\nincreases the signal to noise ratio in samples. The SMRS scheme enables a\nsignificant reduction in the number of channels required when the sampling rate\nincreases. We have demonstrated, using only three sampling channels, an\naccurate sampling and reconstruction of 4 real signals (8 bands). The matrices\nthat are used to reconstruct the signals in the SMRS scheme also have low\ncondition numbers. This indicates that the SMRS scheme is robust to noise in\nsignals. The success of the SMRS scheme relies on the assumption that the\nsampled signals are sparse. As a result most of the sampled spectrum may be\nunaliased in at least one of the sampling channels. This is in contrast to\nmulticoset sampling schemes in which an alias in one channel is equivalent to\nan alias in all channels. We have demonstrated that the SMRS scheme obtains\nsimilar performance using 3 sampling channels and a total sampling rate 8 times\nthe Landau rate to an implementation of a multicoset sampling scheme that uses\n6 sampling channels with a total sampling rate of 13 times the Landau rate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Jun 2008 16:52:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Fleyer", "Michael", ""], ["Rosenthal", "Amir", ""], ["Linden", "Alex", ""], ["Horowitz", "Moshe", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.0604", "submitter": "Wei Wang", "authors": "Wei Wang, Martin J.

It is assumed that the\nCR protects the PR transmission by applying the so-called\ninterference-temperature constraint, whereby the CR is allowed to transmit\nregardless of the PR's on/off status provided that the resultant interference\npower level at the PR receiver is kept below some predefined threshold. For the\nfading PR and CR channels, the interference-power constraint at the PR receiver\nis usually one of the following two types: One is to regulate the average\ninterference power (AIP) over all the fading states, while the other is to\nlimit the peak interference power (PIP) at each fading state. From the CR's\nperspective, given the same average and peak power threshold, the AIP\nconstraint is more favorable than the PIP counterpart because of its more\nflexibility for dynamically allocating transmit powers over the fading states.\nOn the contrary, from the perspective of protecting the PR, the more\nrestrictive PIP constraint appears at a first glance to be a better option than\nthe AIP. Some surprisingly, this paper shows that in terms of various forms of\ncapacity limits achievable for the PR fading channel, e.g., the ergodic and\noutage capacities, the AIP constraint is also superior over the PIP. This\nresult is based upon an interesting interference diversity phenomenon, i.e.,\nrandomized interference powers over the fading states in the AIP case are more\nadvantageous over deterministic ones in the PIP case for minimizing the\nresultant PR capacity losses. Therefore, the AIP constraint results in larger\nfading channel capacities than the PIP for both the CR and PR transmissions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Jun 2008 01:33:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Sep 2008 07:33:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-09-12", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Rui", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.0837", "submitter": "Leonid Reyzin", "authors": "Nenad Dedi\\'c, Gene Itkis, Leonid Reyzin, Scott Russell", "title": "Upper and Lower Bounds on Black-Box Steganography", "comments": "27 pages; to be published in Journal of Cryptology", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s00145-008-9020-3", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.CC cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the limitations of steganography when the sender is not using any\nproperties of the underlying channel beyond its entropy and the ability to\nsample from it.

For the degraded broadcast channel\nwith confidential messages, we present the secrecy capacity region. Our\nachievable coding scheme is based on Cover's superposition scheme and random\nbinning. We refer to this scheme as Secret Superposition Scheme. In this\nscheme, we show that randomization in the first layer increases the secrecy\nrate of the second layer. This capacity region matches the capacity region of\nthe degraded broadcast channel without security constraint. It also matches the\nsecrecy capacity for the conventional wire-tap channel. Our converse proof is\nbased on a combination of the converse proof of the conventional degraded\nbroadcast channel and Csiszar lemma. Finally, we assume that the channels are\nAdditive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and show that secret superposition scheme\nwith Gaussian codebook is optimal. The converse proof is based on the\ngeneralized entropy power inequality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Jun 2008 21:05:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 14 Jul 2008 16:35:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 17 Jul 2008 22:22:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 30 Jul 2008 19:13:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Bagherikaram", "Ghadamali", ""], ["Motahari", "Abolfazl S.", ""], ["Khandani", "Amir K.", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.4264", "submitter": "Jay Kumar Sundararajan", "authors": "Jay Kumar Sundararajan, Devavrat Shah, Muriel M\\'edard", "title": "Online network coding for optimal throughput and delay -- the\n  three-receiver case", "comments": "This is the final version.
