The heterogeneous cellular network is modeled as the\nsuperposition of many tiers of Base Stations (BSs) having different transmit\npower, density, path-loss exponent, fading parameters and distribution, and\nunequal biasing for flexible tier association. A long-term averaged maximum\nbiased-received-power tier association is considered. The positions of the BSs\nin each tier are modeled as points of an independent Poisson Point Process\n(PPP).

The distinguishable\ncharacteristic of our analytical methodology consists in providing a tractable\nand numerically efficient framework that is applicable to general fading\ndistributions, including composite fading channels with small- and mid-scale\nfluctuations. In addition, our method can efficiently handle correlated\nLog-Normal shadowing with little increase of the computational complexity.

Our goal is to\ndesign an artificial noise (AN)-aided transmit strategy, such that the\nachievable secrecy rate is maximized subject to the sum power constraint.\nAN-aided secure transmission has recently been found to be a promising approach\nfor blocking eavesdropping attempts. In many existing studies, the confidential\ninformation transmit covariance and the AN covariance are not simultaneously\noptimized. In particular, for design convenience, it is common to prefix the AN\ncovariance as a specific kind of spatially isotropic covariance. This paper\nconsiders joint optimization of the transmit and AN covariances for secrecy\nrate maximization (SRM), with a design flexibility that the AN can take any\nspatial pattern. Hence, the proposed design has potential in jamming the\neavesdroppers more effectively, based upon the channel state information (CSI).\nWe derive an optimization approach to the SRM problem through both analysis and\nconvex conic optimization machinery. We show that the SRM problem can be recast\nas a single-variable optimization problem, and that resultant problem can be\nefficiently handled by solving a sequence of semidefinite programs. Our\nframework deals with a general setup of multiple multi-antenna eavesdroppers,\nand can cater for additional constraints arising from specific application\nscenarios, such as interference temperature constraints in interference\nnetworks. We also generalize the framework to an imperfect CSI case where a\nworst-case robust SRM formulation is considered. A suboptimal but safe solution\nto the outage-constrained robust SRM design is also investigated.

It is shown that in a typical application\ncase, where uniform data readings are transformed to the same number of\nuniformly spaced frequencies, the results of the classical DFT and proposed\napproach coincide. The difference in performance appears when the length of the\nDFT is selected to be greater than the length of the data. The DFT solves the\nunknown data problem by padding readings with zeros up to the length of the\nDFT, while the proposed Extended DFT (EDFT) deals with this situation in a\ndifferent way, it uses the Fourier integral transform as a target and optimizes\nthe transform basis in the extended frequency range without putting such\nrestrictions on the time domain. Consequently, the Inverse DFT (IDFT) applied\nto the result of EDFT returns not only known readings, but also the\nextrapolated data, where classical DFT is able to give back just zeros, and\nhigher resolution are achieved at frequencies where the data has been\nsuccessfully extended. It has been demonstrated that EDFT able to process data\nwith missing readings or gaps inside or even nonuniformly distributed data.\nThus, EDFT significantly extends the usability of the DFT-based methods, where\npreviously these approaches have been considered as not applicable. The EDFT\nfounds the solution in an iterative way and requires repeated calculations to\nget the adaptive basis, and this makes it numerical complexity much higher\ncompared to DFT.

The asymptotic Bethe approximation is confirmed to be better than the\nconventional Bethe approximation on some conditions. For this purpose, Chertkov\nand Chernyak's loop calculus formula is employed, which shows that the error of\nthe Bethe approximation can be expressed as a sum of weights corresponding to\ngeneralized loops, and generalized for non-binary finite alphabets by using\nconcepts of information geometry.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 9 Mar 2013 05:13:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-12", "authors_parsed": [["Mori", "Ryuhei", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.2173", "submitter": "Pedro Henrique Juliano Nardelli", "authors": "Pedro H.

A robust CRT was recently proposed for a\nspecial case when the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all the moduli is more\nthan 1 and the remaining integers factorized by the gcd of all the moduli are\nco-prime. In this special case, a closed-form reconstruction from erroneous\nremainders was proposed and a necessary and sufficient condition on the\nremainder errors was obtained. It basically says that the reconstruction error\nis upper bounded by the remainder error level $\\tau$ if $\\tau$ is smaller than\na quarter of the gcd of all the moduli. In this paper, we consider the robust\nreconstruction problem for a general set of moduli. We first present a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for the remainder errors for a robust\nreconstruction from erroneous remainders with a general set of muduli and also\na corresponding robust reconstruction method. This can be thought of as a\nsingle stage robust CRT. We then propose a two-stage robust CRT by grouping the\nmoduli into several groups as follows. First, the single stage robust CRT is\napplied to each group. Then, with these robust reconstructions from all the\ngroups, the single stage robust CRT is applied again across the groups. This is\nthen easily generalized to multi-stage robust CRT. Interestingly, with this\ntwo-stage robust CRT, the robust reconstruction holds even when the remainder\nerror level $\\tau$ is above the quarter of the gcd of all the moduli. In this\npaper, we also propose an algorithm on how to group a set of moduli for a\nbetter reconstruction robustness of the two-stage robust CRT in some special\ncases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Mar 2013 19:02:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-15", "authors_parsed": [["Xiao", "Li", ""], ["Xia", "Xiang-Gen", ""], ["Wang", "Wenjie", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.3341", "submitter": "Srimathy Srinivasan", "authors": "Srimathy Srinivasan", "title": "A short proof that all linear codes are weakly algebraic-geometric using\n  Bertini theorems of B.

The practical passive eavesdropping scenario we\nconsider is where channel state information (CSI) from the eavesdropper is not\navailable at the transmitter.

Second, the Alamouti scheme is\nemployed at the selected antennas in order to perform data transmission. At the\nreceiver and the eavesdropper, maximal-ratio combining is applied in order to\nexploit the multiple antennas.We derive a new closed-form expression for the\nsecrecy outage probability in nonidentical Rayleigh fading, and using this\nresult, we then present the probability of non-zero secrecy capacity in closed\nform and the {\\epsilon}-outage secrecy capacity in numerical form.

In this paper, we study a multi-cell multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) broadcast system with RBF applied at each base station\n(BS) and either the minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE), matched filter (MF), or\nantenna selection (AS) based spatial receiver employed at each mobile terminal.\nWe investigate the effect of different spatial diversity receivers on the\nachievable sum-rate of multi-cell RBF systems subject to both the intra- and\ninter-cell interferences. We first derive closed-form expressions for the\ndistributions of the receiver signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)\nwith different spatial diversity techniques, based on which we compare their\nrate performances at finite signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We then investigate\nthe asymptotically high-SNR regime and for a tractable analysis assume that the\nnumber of users in each cell scales in a certain order with the per-cell SNR as\nSNR goes to infinity. Under this setup, we characterize the degrees of freedom\n(DoF) region for multi-cell RBF systems with different types of spatial\nreceivers, which consists of all the achievable DoF tuples for the individual\nsum-rate of all the cells. The DoF region analysis provides a succinct\ncharacterization of the interplays among the receive spatial diversity,\nmultiuser diversity, spatial multiplexing gain, inter-/intra-cell\ninterferences, and BSs' collaborative transmission.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Mar 2013 13:32:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Apr 2013 02:45:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 19 Jun 2013 16:37:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Nguyen", "Hieu Duy", ""], ["Zhang", "Rui", ""], ["Hui", "Hon Tat", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.6017", "submitter": "Zhouyun Wu", "authors": "Zhouyun Wu, Aiping Huang, and Hsiao-Hwa Chen", "title": "Scrambling Code Planning in TD-SCDMA Systems", "comments": "This paper has been withdrawn", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.NI math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial sign error in\nequation 2.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Mar 2013 02:31:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 30 Mar 2013 10:05:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Zhouyun", ""], ["Huang", "Aiping", ""], ["Chen", "Hsiao-Hwa", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.6020", "submitter": "Hong-Bin Chen", "authors": "Fei-Huang Chang, Hong-Bin Chen, Jun-Yi Guo and Yu-Pei Huang", "title": "Multi-Group Testing for Items with Real-Valued Status under Standard\n  Arithmetic", "comments": "presented in part at 2nd Japan-Taiwan Conference of Combinatorics and\n  its Applications, Nagoya University, Japan, 2012", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.CO math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper proposes a novel generalization of group testing, called\nmulti-group testing, which relaxes the notion of \"testing subset\" in group\ntesting to \"testing multi-set\".
