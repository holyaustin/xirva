It is found that the handshapes, as\nfundamental units of ASL, are less redundant than phonemes, the equivalent\nfundamental units of spoken English, and that their entropy is much closer to\nthe maximum possible information content. This explains why the slower signs\ncan produce sentences in the same time as speaking; the low redundancy\ncompensates for the slow rate of sign production. In addition to this precise\nquantification, this work is also novel in its approach towards quantifying an\naspect of the ASL alphabet.

A detailed model for\nconcrete channel estimation and feedback schemes provides parameter input to\nthe former model and covers the most important aspects such as pilot design\noptimization, linear channel estimation, feedback delay, and feedback\nquantization. We apply this framework to determine optimal pilot densities and\nCSI feedback quantity, given that a weighted sum of uplink and downlink\nthroughput is to be maximized for a certain user velocity. We show that for low\nspeed, and if downlink throughput is of particular importance, a significant\nportion of the uplink should be invested into CSI feedback. At higher velocity,\nhowever, downlink performance becomes mainly affected by CSI feedback delay,\nand hence CSI feedback brings little gain considering the inherent sacrifice of\nuplink capacity.

These\nalgorithms are asymmetric regarding encoding/decoding time and memory\nrequirements, with the former being much more demanding. In the past years,\nconsiderable attention has been devoted to the problem of finding efficient\ndata structures to support these searches, aiming at optimizing the encoders in\nterms of speed and memory. Hash tables, binary search trees and suffix trees\nhave been widely used for this purpose, as they allow fast search at the\nexpense of memory. Some recent research has focused on suffix arrays (SA), due\nto their low memory requirements and linear construction algorithms. Previous\nwork has shown how the LZ77 decomposition can be computed using a single SA or\nan SA with an auxiliary array with the longest common prefix information. The\nSA-based algorithms use less memory than the tree-based encoders, allocating\nthe strictly necessary amount of memory, regardless of the contents of the text\nto search/encode. In this paper, we improve on previous work by proposing\nfaster SA-based algorithms for LZ77 encoding and sub-string search, keeping\ntheir low memory requirements. For some compression settings, on a large set of\nbenchmark files, our low-memory SA-based encoders are also faster than\ntree-based encoders. This provides time and memory efficient LZ77 encoding,\nbeing a possible replacement for trees on well known encoders like LZMA. Our\nalgorithm is also suited for text classification, because it provides a compact\nway to describe text in a bag-of-words representation, as well as a fast\nindexing mechanism that allows to quickly find all the sets of words that start\nwith a given symbol, over a static dictionary.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2009 11:45:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-31", "authors_parsed": [["Ferreira", "Artur", ""], ["Oliveira", "Arlindo", ""], ["Figueiredo", "Mario", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.5537", "submitter": "Aram Harrow", "authors": "Charles H.

For channels of\nnonzero capacity, this simulation is always possible, but for it to be\nefficient, auxiliary resources of the proper kind and amount are generally\nrequired. In the classical case, shared randomness between sender and receiver\nis a sufficient auxiliary resource, regardless of the nature of the source, but\nin the quantum case the requisite auxiliary resources for efficient simulation\ndepend on both the channel being simulated, and the source from which the\nchannel inputs are coming. For tensor power sources (the quantum generalization\nof classical IID sources), entanglement in the form of standard ebits\n(maximally entangled pairs of qubits) is sufficient, but for general sources,\nwhich may be arbitrarily correlated or entangled across channel inputs,\nadditional resources, such as entanglement-embezzling states or backward\ncommunication, are generally needed. Combining existing and new results, we\nestablish the amounts of communication and auxiliary resources needed in both\nthe classical and quantum cases, the tradeoffs among them, and the loss of\nsimulation efficiency when auxiliary resources are absent or insufficient. In\nparticular we find a new single-letter expression for the excess forward\ncommunication cost of coherent feedback simulations of quantum channels (i.e.\nsimulations in which the sender retains what would escape into the environment\nin an ordinary simulation), on non-tensor-power sources in the presence of\nunlimited ebits but no other auxiliary resource.
