The architecture consists of two components, an aperture assembly\nand a sensor. No lens is used. The aperture assembly consists of a two\ndimensional array of aperture elements. The transmittance of each aperture\nelement is independently controllable. The sensor is a single detection\nelement, such as a single photo-conductive cell. Each aperture element together\nwith the sensor defines a cone of a bundle of rays, and the cones of the\naperture assembly define the pixels of an image. Each pixel value of an image\nis the integration of the bundle of rays in a cone. The sensor is used for\ntaking compressive measurements. Each measurement is the integration of rays in\nthe cones modulated by the transmittance of the aperture elements. A\ncompressive sensing matrix is implemented by adjusting the transmittance of the\nindividual aperture elements according to the values of the sensing matrix. The\nproposed architecture is simple and reliable because no lens is used.\nFurthermore, the sharpness of an image from our device is only limited by the\nresolution of the aperture assembly, but not affected by blurring due to\ndefocus. The architecture can be used for capturing images of visible lights,\nand other spectra such as infrared, or millimeter waves. Such devices may be\nused in surveillance applications for detecting anomalies or extracting\nfeatures such as speed of moving objects. Multiple sensors may be used with a\nsingle aperture assembly to capture multi-view images simultaneously.

One of the main challenges in the analysis of fading\nnetworks, specifically multi-receiver networks including fading ICs, is to\nobtain efficient capacity outer bounds. In this paper, a novel capacity outer\nbound is established for the two-user ergodic fading IC. For this purpose, by a\nsubtle combination of broadcast channel techniques (i.e., manipulating mutual\ninformation functions composed of vector random variables by Csiszar-Korner\nidentity) and genie-aided techniques, first a single-letter outer bound\ncharacterized by mutual information functions including some auxiliary random\nvariables is derived. Then, by novel arguments the derived bound is optimized\nover its auxiliaries only using the entropy power inequality. Besides being\nwell-described, our outer bound is efficient from several aspects.\nSpecifically, it is optimal for the fading IC with uniformly strong\ninterference. Also, it is sum-rate optimal for the channel with uniformly mixed\ninterference. More importantly, it is proved that when each transmitter has\naccess to any amount of CSIT that includes the interference to noise ratio of\nits non-corresponding receiver, the outer bound differs by no more than one bit\nfrom the achievable rate region given by Han-Kobayashi scheme.

Recently, researchers have made progress on\ndesigning efficient circuits and devices for RF energy harvesting suitable for\nlow-power wireless applications. Motivated by this and building upon the\nclassic cognitive radio (CR) network model, this paper proposes a novel method\nfor wireless networks coexisting where low-power mobiles in a secondary\nnetwork, called secondary transmitters (STs), harvest ambient RF energy from\ntransmissions by nearby active transmitters in a primary network, called\nprimary transmitters (PTs), while opportunistically accessing the spectrum\nlicensed to the primary network. We consider a stochastic-geometry model in\nwhich PTs and STs are distributed as independent homogeneous Poisson point\nprocesses (HPPPs) and communicate with their intended receivers at fixed\ndistances. Each PT is associated with a guard zone to protect its intended\nreceiver from ST's interference, and at the same time delivers RF energy to STs\nlocated in its harvesting zone. Based on the proposed model, we analyze the\ntransmission probability of STs and the resulting spatial throughput of the\nsecondary network. The optimal transmission power and density of STs are\nderived for maximizing the secondary network throughput under the given\noutage-probability constraints in the two coexisting networks, which reveal key\ninsights to the optimal network design. Finally, we show that our analytical\nresult can be generally applied to a non-CR setup, where distributed wireless\npower chargers are deployed to power coexisting wireless transmitters in a\nsensor network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 02:26:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Jul 2013 05:41:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Lee", "Seunghyun", ""], ["Zhang", "Rui", ""], ["Huang", "Kaibin", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.4805", "submitter": "Xiaoming Chen", "authors": "Xiaoming Chen and Lei Lei", "title": "Energy-Efficient Optimization for Physical Layer Security in\n  Multi-Antenna Downlink Networks with QoS Guarantee", "comments": "4 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": "IEEE Communications Letters 2013", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  In this letter, we consider a multi-antenna downlink network where a secure\nuser (SU) coexists with a passive eavesdropper.

The CSIT is\ngiven by an arbitrary deterministic function of the channel state. This\ncharacteristic yields a full control over how much state information is\navailable, from perfect to no information. In literature, capacity derivations\nfor wireless ergodic fading channels, specifically for fading BCs, mostly rely\non the analysis of channels comprising of parallel sub-channels. This technique\nis usually suitable for the cases where perfect state information is available\nat the transmitters. In this paper, new arguments are proposed to directly\nderive (without resorting to the analysis of parallel channels) capacity bounds\nfor the two-user fading BC with both common and private messages based on the\nexisting bounds for the discrete channel. Specifically, a novel approach is\ndeveloped to adapt and evaluate the well-known UV-outer bound for the Gaussian\nfading channel using the entropy power inequality. Our approach indeed sheds\nlight on the role of broadcast auxiliaries in the fading channel. It is shown\nthat the derived outer bound is optimal for the channel with perfect CSIT as\nwell as for some special cases with partial CSIT. Our outer bound is also\ndirectly applicable to the case without CSIT which has been recently considered\nin several papers. Next, the approach is developed to analyze for the fading BC\nwith secrecy. In the case of perfect CSIT, a full characterization of the\nsecrecy capacity region is derived for the channel with common and confidential\nmessages.

Even\nthough the research focus has been on time correlated channels so far, a\nsimilar but different problem concerns the frequency correlated channels.\nIndeed, the imperfect CSIT also impacts the DoF region of frequency correlated\nchannels, as exemplified by current multi-carrier wireless systems.\n  This contribution, for the first time in the literature, investigates a\ngeneral frequency correlated setting where a two-antenna transmitter has\nimperfect knowledge of CSI of two single-antenna users on two adjacent\nsubbands. A new scheme is derived as an integration of Zero-Forcing Beamforming\n(ZFBF) and the scheme proposed by Maddah-Ali and Tse. The achievable DoF region\nresulted by this scheme is expressed as a function of the qualities of CSIT.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Feb 2013 18:14:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 Apr 2013 14:38:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Hao", "Chenxi", ""], ["Clerckx", "Bruno", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.6562", "submitter": "Daniel Cullina", "authors": "Daniel Cullina and Negar Kiyavash", "title": "An Improvement to Levenshtein's Upper Bound on the Cardinality of\n  Deletion Correcting Codes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.DM math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider deletion correcting codes over a q-ary alphabet.
