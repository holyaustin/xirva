For paths on at most five vertices and cycles on at\nmost six vertices the on-line and offline complexities are equal, while for\nother paths and cycles these values differ. We show that the gap between these\nvalues can be arbitrarily large even for graph based access structures. We\npresent a general on-line secret sharing scheme that we call first-fit. Its\ncomplexity is the maximal degree of the access structure. We show, however,\nthat this on-line scheme is never optimal: the on-line complexity is always\nstrictly less than the maximal degree. On the other hand, we give examples\nwhere the first-fit scheme is almost optimal, namely, the on-line complexity\ncan be arbitrarily close to the maximal degree. The performance ratio is the\nratio of the on-line and off-line complexities of the same access structure. We\nshow that for graphs the performance ratio is smaller than the number of\nvertices, and for an infinite family of graphs the performance ratio is at\nleast constant times the square root of the number of vertices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Feb 2014 14:46:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Csirmaz", "Laszlo", ""], ["Tardos", "G\u00e1bor", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.1384", "submitter": "Florent Krzakala", "authors": "Florent Krzakala and Andre Manoel and Eric W.

In\naddition, we provide further improvements on both the previously proposed\nhierarchical cooperation schemes by a more efficient use of TDMA and spatial\nreuse. Thanks to our explicit achievable rate expressions, we can compare HC\nscheme with multihop routing (MR), where the latter can be regarded as the\ncurrent practice of D2D wireless networks. Our results show that the improved\nand optimized HC schemes yield very significant rate gains over MR in realistic\nconditions of channel propagation exponents, signal to noise ratio, and number\nof users. This sheds light on the long-standing question about the real\nadvantage of HC scheme over MR beyond the well-known scaling laws analysis. In\ncontrast, we also show that our rate optimization is non-trivial, since when HC\nis applied with off-the-shelf choice of the system parameters, no significant\nrate gain with respect to MR is achieved. We also show that for large pathloss\nexponent the sum rate is a nearly linear function of the number of users $n$ in\nthe range of networks of practical size.

In the method, the\nmaximum passband ripple and minimum stopband attenuation are ensured to be\nwithin prescribed levels, while at the same time maintaining a good\nlinear-phase characteristic at a prescribed group delay in the passband. Since\nthe beamformer is intended primarily for small-sized microphone arrays where\nthe microphone spacing is small relative to the wavelength at low frequencies,\nthe beamformer can become highly sensitive to spatial white noise and array\nimperfections if a direct minimization of the error is performed. Therefore, to\nlimit the sensitivity of the beamformer the optimization is carried out by\nconstraining a sensitivity parameter, namely, the white noise gain (WNG) to be\nabove prescribed levels across the frequency band. Two novel design variants\nhave been developed. The first variant is formulated as a convex optimization\nproblem where the maximum error in the passband is minimized, while the second\nvariant is formulated as an iterative optimization problem and has the\nadvantage of significantly improving the linear-phase characteristics of the\nbeamformer under any prescribed group delay or linear-array configuration. In\nthe second variant, the passband group-delay deviation is minimized while\nensuring that the maximum passband ripple and stopband attenuation are within\nprescribed levels. To reduce the computational effort in carrying out the\noptimization, a nonuniform variable sampling approach over the frequency and\nangular dimensions is used to compute the required parameters. Experiment\nresults show that beamformers designed using the proposed methods have much\nsmaller passband group-delay deviation for similar passband ripple and stopband\nattenuation than a modified version of an existing method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Feb 2014 22:56:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Nongpiur", "R.

First, the problem\nis studied in the symmetric linear deterministic IC (SLDIC) setting, and\nachievable schemes are proposed, based on interference cancelation, relaying of\nthe other user's data bits, and transmission of random bits. In the proposed\nachievable scheme, the limited rate cooperative link is used to share a\ncombination of data bits and random bits depending on the model parameters.\nOuter bounds on the secrecy rate are also derived, using a novel partitioning\nof the encoded messages and outputs depending on the relative strength of the\nsignal and the interference. The inner and outer bounds are derived under all\npossible parameter settings. It is found that, for some parameter settings, the\ninner and outer bounds match, yielding the capacity of the SLDIC under\ntransmitter cooperation and secrecy constraints. In some other scenarios, the\nachievable rate matches with the capacity region of the 2-user SLDIC without\nsecrecy constraints derived by Wang and Tse [1]; thus, the proposed scheme\noffers secrecy for free, in these cases. Inspired by the achievable schemes and\nouter bounds in the deterministic case, achievable schemes and outer bounds are\nderived in the Gaussian case. The proposed achievable scheme for the Gaussian\ncase is based on Marton's coding scheme and stochastic encoding along with\ndummy message transmission. One of the key techniques used in the achievable\nscheme for both the models is interference cancelation, which simultaneously\noffers two seemingly conflicting benefits: it cancels interference and ensures\nsecrecy.

The\nanalysis shows that after realistic antenna isolation and RF cancellation, the\ndominant self-interference waveform at receiver digital baseband can be modeled\nthrough a widely-linear transformation of the original transmit data, opposed\nto classical purely linear models. Such widely-linear self-interference\nwaveform is physically stemming from the transmitter and receiver IQ imaging,\nand cannot be efficiently suppressed by classical linear digital cancellation.\nMotivated by this, novel widely-linear digital self-interference cancellation\nprocessing is then proposed and formulated, combined with efficient parameter\nestimation methods.

Previous work relied on simple suboptimal counting rules for\ndecision fusion in order to avoid the exhaustive numerical search required for\nobtaining the optimal thresholds. However, these simple rules are not globally\noptimal as they do not maximize the overall global detection probability by\njointly selecting local and global thresholds. Instead, they maximize the\ndetection probability for a specific global threshold. In this paper, a\nglobally optimal decision fusion rule for Primary User signal detection based\non the Neyman- Pearson (NP) criterion is derived. The algorithm is based on a\nnovel representation for the global performance metrics in terms of the\nregularized incomplete beta function. Based on this mathematical\nrepresentation, it is shown that the globally optimal NP hard decision fusion\ntest can be put in the form of a conventional one dimensional convex\noptimization problem. A binary search for the global threshold can be applied\nyielding a complexity of O(log2(N)), where N represents the number of\ncooperating users. The logarithmic complexity is appreciated because we are\nconcerned with dense networks, and thus N is expected to be large. The proposed\noptimal scheme outperforms conventional counting rules, such as the OR, AND,\nand MAJORITY rules. It is shown via simulations that, although the optimal rule\ntends to the simple OR rule when the number of cooperating secondary users is\nsmall, it offers significant SNR gain in dense cognitive radio networks with\nlarge number of cooperating users.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Feb 2014 17:04:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Alaa", "Ahmed M.", ""], ["Nasr", "Omar A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.6286", "submitter": "Richard Kueng", "authors": "David Gross, Felix Krahmer, and Richard Kueng", "title": "Improved Recovery Guarantees for Phase Retrieval from Coded Diffraction\n  Patterns", "comments": "28 pages, in press, Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis\n  (2015)", "journal-ref": "Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis 42(1), 37-64 (2016)", "doi": "10.1016/j.acha.2015.05.004", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work we analyze the problem of phase retrieval from Fourier\nmeasurements with random diffraction patterns.

Leveraging\nconcepts from stochastic geometry, this paper proposes a general framework to\nevaluate the coverage and rate performance in mmWave cellular networks. Using a\ndistance-dependent line-of-site (LOS) probability function, the locations of\nthe LOS and non-LOS base stations are modeled as two independent\nnon-homogeneous Poisson point processes, to which different path loss laws are\napplied. Based on the proposed framework, expressions for the\nsignal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SINR) and rate coverage probability are\nderived. The mmWave coverage and rate performance are examined as a function of\nthe antenna geometry and base station density. The case of dense networks is\nfurther analyzed by applying a simplified system model, in which the LOS region\nof a user is approximated as a fixed LOS ball. The results show that dense\nmmWave networks can achieve comparable coverage and much higher data rates than\nconventional UHF cellular systems, despite the presence of blockages. The\nresults suggest that the cell size to achieve the optimal SINR scales with the\naverage size of the area that is LOS to a user.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Feb 2014 06:33:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 1 Mar 2014 17:53:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 18 Oct 2014 21:17:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-21", "authors_parsed": [["Bai", "Tianyang", ""], ["Heath", "Robert W.", "Jr"]]}, {"id": "1402.6441", "submitter": "Seunghyun Lee", "authors": "Seunghyun Lee, Liang Liu, and Rui Zhang", "title": "Collaborative Wireless Energy and Information Transfer in Interference\n  Channel", "comments": "To appear in IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TWC.2014.2354335", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper studies the simultaneous wireless information and power transfer\n(SWIPT) in a multiuser wireless system, in which distributed transmitters send\nindependent messages to their respective receivers, and at the same time\ncooperatively transmit wireless power to the receivers via energy beamforming.\nAccordingly, from the wireless information transmission (WIT) perspective, the\nsystem of interest can be modeled as the classic interference channel, while it\nalso can be regarded as a distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)\nsystem for collaborative wireless energy transmission (WET).

By quantizing multiple channel entries\nsimultaneously using standardized codebooks in a state transition of trellis\nsearch, TEC can achieve fractional bits per channel entry quantization to have\na practical feedback overhead. Thus, TEC can solve both the complexity and the\nfeedback overhead issues of CSI quantization in massive MIMO systems.

Further, we will show that the tools for analyzing\nthe ensuing achievable rates from an optimized CS receiver are precisely the\nsame as those used for analyzing the achievable rates of a minimum mean square\nerror (MMSE) receiver.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Feb 2014 14:30:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-03", "authors_parsed": [["Rusek", "Fredrik", ""], ["Edfors", "Ove", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.7350", "submitter": "Yoav Shechtman", "authors": "Yoav Shechtman, Yonina C.
