The objectives are twofold:\nmaximizing the sum offloading rate, quantifying MEC throughput, and minimizing\nthe migration cost. The policy design is formulated as a decision-optimization\nproblem that accounts for virtualization, I/O interference between virtual\nmachines (VMs), and wireless multi-access. To solve the complex combinatorial\nproblem, we develop an efficient relaxation-and-rounding based solution\napproach. The approach relies on an optimal iterative algorithm for solving the\ninteger-relaxed problem and a novel integer-recovery design. The latter\noutperforms the traditional rounding method by exploiting the derived problem\nproperties and applying matching theory. In addition, we also consider the\ndesign for a special case of \"hotspot mitigation\", referring to alleviating an\noverloaded server/BS by migrating its load to the nearby idle servers/BSs. From\nsimulation results, we observed close-to-optimal performance of the proposed\nmigration policies under various settings. This demonstrates their efficiency\nin computation-and-radio resource management for joint service migration and BS\nhandover in multi-cell MEC networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Feb 2021 07:35:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-08", "authors_parsed": [["Liang", "Zezu", ""], ["Liu", "Yuan", ""], ["Lok", "Tat-Ming", ""], ["Huang", "Kaibin", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.03040", "submitter": "Bernard Mans", "authors": "Dalia Popescu, Philippe Jacquet and Bernard Mans", "title": "Connecting flying backhauls of UAVs to enhance vehicular networks with\n  fixed 5G NR infrastructure", "comments": "30 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.IT cs.NI math.IT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  This paper investigates moving networks of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs),\nsuch as drones, as one of the innovative opportunities brought by the 5G.

One way to\nsimplify planning for these tasks is to focus on maximizing sensing performance\nover a short time horizon. Specifically, consider the problem of how to select\nmotions for a team of robots to maximize a notion of sensing quality (the\nsensing objective) over the near future, say by maximizing the amount of\nunknown space in a map that robots will observe over the next several seconds.\nBy repeating this process regularly, the team can react quickly to new\nobservations as they work to complete the sensing task. In technical terms,\nthis planning and control process forms an example of receding-horizon control.\nFortunately, common sensing objectives benefit from well-known monotonicity\nproperties (e.g. submodularity), and greedy algorithms can exploit these\nmonotonicity properties to solve the receding-horizon optimization problems\nthat we study near-optimally.\n  However, greedy algorithms typically force robots to make decisions\nsequentially so that planning time grows with the number of robots. Further,\nrecent works that investigate sequential greedy planning, have demonstrated\nthat reducing the number of sequential steps while retaining suboptimality\nguarantees can be hard or impossible.\n  We demonstrate that halting growth in planning time is sometimes possible.

We consider a system\nin which a central monitor observes multiple binary Markov processes through a\ncommunication channel. The UoI of a Markov process corresponds to the monitor's\nuncertainty about its state. At each time step, only one Markov process can be\nselected to update its state to the monitor; hence there is a tradeoff among\nthe UoIs of the processes that depend on the scheduling policy used to select\nthe process to be updated. The age of information (AoI) of a process\ncorresponds to the time since its last update. In general, the associated UoI\ncan be a non-increasing function, or even an oscillating function, of its AoI,\nmaking the scheduling problem particularly challenging. This paper investigates\nscheduling policies that aim to minimize the average sum-UoI of the processes\nover the infinite time horizon. We formulate the problem as a restless\nmulti-armed bandit (RMAB) problem, and develop a Whittle index policy that is\nnear-optimal for the RMAB after proving its indexability. We further provide an\niterative algorithm to compute the Whittle index for the practical deployment\nof the policy.

Effectively, these channel limitations lead to unreliable\nintermittent links as a result of a short communication range, and a high\nsusceptibility to blockage and molecular absorption. Consequently, such\nimpediments could disrupt the THz band's promise of high-rate communications\nand high-resolution sensing capabilities. In this context, this paper\npanoramically examines the steps needed to efficiently deploy and operate\nnext-generation THz wireless systems that will synergistically support a\nfellowship of communication and sensing services. For this purpose, we first\nset the stage by describing the fundamentals of the THz frequency band.

By comparing simulation results\nwith conventional methods, it turns out that RSMA is quite robust to imperfect\nCSIR and CSIT, thereby improving the sum-rate performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Feb 2021 13:04:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-22", "authors_parsed": [["An", "Jihye", ""], ["Dizdar", "Onur", ""], ["Clerckx", "Bruno", ""], ["Shin", "Wonjae", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.08739", "submitter": "Qingqing Wu", "authors": "Qingqing Wu, Xiaobo Zhou, Robert Schober", "title": "IRS-Assisted Wireless Powered NOMA: Do We Really Need Different Phase\n  Shifts in DL and UL?", "comments": "We unveiled in the paper that dynamic IRS beamforming is not needed\n  for wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs) employing NOMA.

Due to the close relation\nbetween Lapalcian spectrum and degree sequence, we conjecture that the\nstructural information, defined as the Shannon entropy of the normalized degree\nsequence, might be a good approximation of the von Neumann graph entropy that\nis both scalable and interpretable.\n  In this work, we thereby study the difference between the structural\ninformation and von Neumann graph entropy named as {\\em entropy gap}. Based on\nthe knowledge that the degree sequence is majorized by the Laplacian spectrum,\nwe for the first time prove the entropy gap is between $0$ and $\\log_2 e$ in\nany undirected unweighted graphs. Consequently we certify that the structural\ninformation is a good approximation of the von Neumann graph entropy that\nachieves provable accuracy, scalability, and interpretability simultaneously.\nThis approximation is further applied to two entropy-related tasks: network\ndesign and graph similarity measure, where novel graph similarity measure and\nfast algorithms are proposed. Our experimental results on graphs of various\nscales and types show that the very small entropy gap readily applies to a wide\nrange of graphs and weighted graphs. As an approximation of the von Neumann\ngraph entropy, the structural information is the only one that achieves both\nhigh efficiency and high accuracy among the prominent methods.

The practicality of such a methodology is reinforced by\nmaking use of real communication data from a visible light communication\nsystem.

We prove\nthat, so long as the constraint is feasible, this problem admits a unique\nsolution, it is in the exponential family, and it can be learned by solving a\nconvex optimization problem. The resulting estimator, which we denote MIND, is\nmarginal-invariant, always non-negative, unbounded for any sample size $n$,\nconsistent, has MSE rate $O(1/n)$, and is more data-efficient than competing\napproaches. Beyond mutual information estimation, we illustrate that our\napproach may be used to mitigate mode collapse in GANs by maximizing the\nentropy of the copula of fake samples, a model we refer to as Copula Entropy\nRegularized GAN (CER-GAN).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Feb 2021 21:21:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 25 Mar 2021 17:01:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-26", "authors_parsed": [["Samo", "Yves-Laurent Kom", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.13270", "submitter": "Youfa Li", "authors": "Youfa Li, Shengli Fan, Yanfen Huang", "title": "Single-angle Radon samples based reconstruction of functions in\n  refinable shift-invariant space", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The traditional approaches to computerized tomography (CT) depend on the\nsamples of Radon transform at multiple angles.

Current causally consistent data stores use\npartial or full replication to ensure data access to clients over a distributed\nsetting.\n  In this paper, we develop, for the first time, an erasure coding based\nalgorithm called CausalEC that ensures causal consistency for a collection of\nread-write objects stored in a distributed set of nodes over an asynchronous\nmessage passing system. CausalEC can use an arbitrary linear erasure code for\ndata storage, and ensures liveness and storage properties prescribed by the\nerasure code.\n  CausalEC retains a key benefit of previously designed replication-based\nalgorithms - every write operation is local, that is, a server performs only\nlocal actions before returning to a client that issued a write operation. For\nservers that store certain objects in an uncoded manner, read operations to\nthose objects also return locally. In general, a read operation to an object\ncan be returned by a server on contacting a small subset of other servers so\nlong as the underlying erasure code allows for the object to be decoded from\nthat subset. As a byproduct, we develop EventualEC, a new eventually consistent\nerasure coding based data storage algorithm.\n  A novel technical aspect of CausalEC is the use of cross-object erasure\ncoding, where nodes encode values across multiple objects, unlike previous\nconsistent erasure coding based solutions. CausalEC navigates the technical\nchallenges of cross-object erasure coding, in particular, pertaining to\nre-encoding the objects when writes update the values and ensuring that reads\nare served in the transient state where the system transitions to storing the\ncodeword symbols corresponding to the new object versions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Feb 2021 05:56:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 8 Mar 2021 02:39:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-09", "authors_parsed": [["Cadambe", "Viveck R.", ""], ["Lyu", "Shihang", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.13359", "submitter": "Ramin Hashemi", "authors": "Ramin Hashemi, Hamzeh Beyranvand, Mohammad Robat Mili, Ata Khalili,\n  Hina Tabassum, and Derrick Wing Kwan Ng", "title": "Energy Efficiency Maximization in the Uplink Delta-OMA Networks", "comments": "This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.\n  Copyright may be transferred without notice, after which this version may no\n  longer be accessible", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TVT.2021.3097128", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT eess.SP math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Delta-orthogonal multiple access (D-OMA) has been recently investigated as a\npotential technique to enhance the spectral efficiency in the sixth-generation\n(6G) networks.
