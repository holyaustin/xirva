Toward this\nend, the two-user MIMO (multiple-input, multiple-output) broadcast and\ninterference channels are studied with no side-information whatsoever at the\ntransmitters and with receivers equipped with full-duplex radios. The\nfull-duplex feature allows for receiver cooperation because each receiver, in\naddition to receiving the signals sent by the transmitters, can also\nsimultaneously transmit a signal in the same band to the other receiver. Unlike\nthe case of MIMO networks with CSIT and full-duplex receivers, for which DoF\nare known, it is shown that for MIMO networks with no CSIT, full-duplex\nreceiver cooperation is beneficial to such an extent that even the DoF region\nis enhanced. Indeed, for important classes of two-user MIMO broadcast and\ninterference channels, defined by certain relationships on numbers of antennas\nat different terminals, the exact DoF regions are established. The key to\nachieving DoF-optimal performance for such networks are new retro-cooperative\ninterference alignment schemes.

Coordinated resource allocation is the\nkey to efficient performance, but the demand on backhaul signaling and\ncomputational resources grows rapidly with number of cells, terminals, and\nsubcarriers. To handle this, we propose a novel multicell framework with\ndynamic cooperation clusters where each terminal is jointly served by a small\nset of base stations. Each base station coordinates interference to neighboring\nterminals only, thus limiting backhaul signalling and making the framework\nscalable. This framework can describe anything from interference channels to\nideal joint multicell transmission.\n  The resource allocation (i.e., precoding and scheduling) is formulated as an\noptimization problem (P1) with performance described by arbitrary monotonic\nfunctions of the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios (SINRs) and arbitrary\nlinear power constraints. Although (P1) is non-convex and difficult to solve\noptimally, we are able to prove: 1) Optimality of single-stream beamforming; 2)\nConditions for full power usage; and 3) A precoding parametrization based on a\nfew parameters between zero and one.

For example, it is desirable to have a small duty cycle in some low\npower systems; a half-duplex radio cannot keep transmitting if it wishes to\nreceive useful signals; and a cognitive radio needs to listen and detect\nprimary users frequently. This work studies the capacity of scalar\ndiscrete-time Gaussian channels subject to duty cycle constraint as well as\naverage transmit power constraint. An idealized duty cycle constraint is first\nstudied, which can be regarded as a requirement on the minimum fraction of\nnontransmissions or zero symbols in each codeword. A unique discrete input\ndistribution is shown to achieve the channel capacity. In many situations,\nnumerically optimized on-off signaling can achieve much higher rate than\nGaussian signaling over a deterministic transmission schedule. This is in part\nbecause the positions of nontransmissions in a codeword can convey information.\nFurthermore, a more realistic duty cycle constraint is studied, where the extra\ncost of transitions between transmissions and nontransmissions due to pulse\nshaping is accounted for. The capacity-achieving input is no longer independent\nover time and is hard to compute. A lower bound of the achievable rate as a\nfunction of the input distribution is shown to be maximized by a first-order\nMarkov input process, the distribution of which is also discrete and can be\ncomputed efficiently.

The secure d.o.f.\nof the canonical Gaussian wiretap channel with no helpers is zero. It has been\nknown that a strictly positive secure d.o.f. can be obtained in the Gaussian\nwiretap channel by using a helper which sends structured cooperative signals.\nWe show that the exact secure d.o.f. of the Gaussian wiretap channel with a\nhelper is 1/2. Our achievable scheme is based on real interference alignment\nand cooperative jamming, which renders the message signal and the cooperative\njamming signal separable at the legitimate receiver, but aligns them perfectly\nat the eavesdropper preventing any reliable decoding of the message signal. Our\nconverse is based on two key lemmas. The first lemma quantifies the secrecy\npenalty by showing that the net effect of an eavesdropper on the system is that\nit eliminates one of the independent channel inputs. The second lemma\nquantifies the role of a helper by developing a direct relationship between the\ncooperative jamming signal of a helper and the message rate.

In a broader perspective, the\ntwo-way traffic pattern is rather limited and it is of interest to investigate\nother traffic patterns where such a simultaneous processing of information\nflows can bring performance advantage.

Such a coding scheme provides an efficient solution\nto the index coding problem and its lower computation and energy cost makes it\nsuitable for practical implementation on devices with limited processing and\nenergy capacity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Sep 2012 14:51:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Qureshi", "Jalaluddin", ""], ["Foh", "Chuan Heng", ""], ["Cai", "Jianfei", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.6558", "submitter": "Maximilien Gadouleau", "authors": "Maximilien Gadouleau", "title": "Closure solvability for network coding and secret sharing", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Network coding is a new technique to transmit data through a network by\nletting the intermediate nodes combine the packets they receive. Given a\nnetwork, the network coding solvability problem decides whether all the packets\nrequested by the destinations can be transmitted. In this paper, we introduce a\nnew approach to this problem. We define a closure operator on a digraph closely\nrelated to the network coding instance and we show that the constraints for\nnetwork coding can all be expressed according to that closure operator. Thus, a\nsolution for the network coding problem is equivalent to a so-called solution\nof the closure operator. We can then define the closure solvability problem in\ngeneral, which surprisingly reduces to finding secret-sharing matroids when the\nclosure operator is a matroid. Based on this reformulation, we can easily prove\nthat any multiple unicast where each node receives at least as many arcs as\nthere are sources is solvable by linear functions. We also give an alternative\nproof that any nontrivial multiple unicast with two source-receiver pairs is\nalways solvable over all sufficiently large alphabets. Based on singular\nproperties of the closure operator, we are able to generalise the way in which\nnetworks can be split into two distinct parts; we also provide a new way of\nidentifying and removing useless nodes in a network. We also introduce the\nconcept of network sharing, where one solvable network can be used to\naccommodate another solvable network coding instance. Finally, the guessing\ngraph approach to network coding solvability is generalised to any closure\noperator, which yields bounds on the amount of information that can be\ntransmitted through a network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Sep 2012 16:04:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 14 Nov 2012 14:27:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 23 Jul 2013 17:07:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-24", "authors_parsed": [["Gadouleau", "Maximilien", ""]]}]
