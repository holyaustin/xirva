In doing so, we consider a family of\ngeneric goodput-based utilities that facilitate, e.g., throughput-based\npricing, quality-of-service enforcement, and/or the treatment of practical\nmodulation-and-coding schemes (MCS). Since perfect knowledge of channel state\ninformation (CSI) may be difficult to maintain at the base-station, especially\nwhen the number of users and/or subchannels is large, we consider scheduling\nand resource allocation under imperfect CSI, where the channel state is\ndescribed by a generic probability distribution. First, we consider the\n\"continuous\" case where multiple users and/or code rates can time-share a\nsingle OFDMA subchannel and time slot. This yields a non-convex optimization\nproblem that we convert into a convex optimization problem and solve exactly\nusing a dual optimization approach. Second, we consider the \"discrete\" case\nwhere only a single user and code rate is allowed per OFDMA subchannel per time\nslot. For the mixed-integer optimization problem that arises, we discuss the\nconnections it has with the continuous case and show that it can solved exactly\nin some situations. For the other situations, we present a bound on the\noptimality gap. For both cases, we provide algorithmic implementations of the\nobtained solution. Finally, we study, numerically, the performance of the\nproposed algorithms under various degrees of CSI uncertainty, utilities, and\nOFDMA system configurations. In addition, we demonstrate advantages relative to\nexisting state-of-the-art algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Oct 2010 21:52:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 3 Mar 2011 18:44:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 29 Jun 2011 17:42:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Aggarwal", "Rohit", ""], ["Assaad", "Mohamad", ""], ["Koksal", "C.

Compared to other proposed non-interactive\nlocalization algorithms, the weighted centroid localization (WCL) scheme uses\nonly the received signal strength information, which makes it simple to\nimplement and robust to variations in the propagation environment. In this\npaper we present the first theoretical framework for WCL performance analysis\nin terms of its localization error distribution parameterized by node density,\nnode placement, shadowing variance, correlation distance and inaccuracy of\nsensor node positioning. Using this analysis, we quantify the robustness of WCL\nto various physical conditions and provide design guidelines, such as node\nplacement and spacing, for the practical deployment of WCL. We also propose a\npower-efficient method for implementing WCL through a distributed cluster-based\nalgorithm, that achieves comparable accuracy with its centralized counterpart.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Nov 2010 08:38:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 7 Dec 2010 23:00:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 9 May 2011 22:37:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Jun", ""], ["Urriza", "Paulo", ""], ["Han", "Yuxing", ""], ["\u010cabri\u0107", "Danijela", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.2361", "submitter": "Nihar Shah B", "authors": "Nihar B.

However, regenerating codes possess in\naddition, the ability to repair a failed node by connecting to an arbitrary\nsubset of d nodes. It has been shown that for the case of functional-repair,\nthere is a tradeoff between the amount of data stored per node and the\nbandwidth required to repair a failed node. A special case of functional-repair\nis exact-repair where the replacement node is required to store data identical\nto that in the failed node. Exact-repair is of interest as it greatly\nsimplifies system implementation. The first result of the paper is an explicit,\nexact-repair code for the point on the storage-bandwidth tradeoff corresponding\nto the minimum possible repair bandwidth, for the case when d=n-1. This code\nhas a particularly simple graphical description and most interestingly, has the\nability to carry out exact-repair through mere transfer of data and without any\nneed to perform arithmetic operations. Hence the term `repair-by-transfer'. The\nsecond result of this paper shows that the interior points on the\nstorage-bandwidth tradeoff cannot be achieved under exact-repair, thus pointing\nto the existence of a separate tradeoff under exact-repair. Specifically, we\nidentify a set of scenarios, termed `helper node pooling', and show that it is\nthe necessity to satisfy such scenarios that over-constrains the system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Nov 2010 12:34:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 16 Nov 2010 11:00:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Shah", "Nihar B.", ""], ["Rashmi", "K.

Why are such pairwise models so successful in some\ninstances, but insufficient in others? Here, we study the emergence of\nhigher-order interactions in simple circuits with different architectures and\ninputs. We quantify the impact of higher-order interactions by comparing the\nresponses of mechanistic circuit models vs. \"null\" descriptions in which all\nhigher-than-pairwise correlations have been accounted for by lower order\nstatistics, known as pairwise maximum entropy models.\n  We find that bimodal input signals produce larger deviations from pairwise\npredictions than unimodal inputs for circuits with local and global\nconnectivity. Moreover, recurrent coupling can accentuate these deviations, if\ncoupling strengths are neither too weak nor too strong. A circuit model based\non intracellular recordings from ON parasol retinal ganglion cells shows that a\nbroad range of light signals induce unimodal inputs to spike generators, and\nthat coupling strengths produce weak effects on higher-order interactions.

In this paper, we will analyze\ndelay in random access multi-hop networks and solve the delay-constrained\nutility maximization problem. We define the network utility as a combination of\nrate utility and energy cost functions and solve the following two problems:\n'optimal medium access control with link delay constraint' and, 'optimal\ncongestion and contention control with end-to-end delay constraint'. The\noptimal tradeoff between delay, rate, and energy is achieved for different\nvalues of delay constraint and the scaling factors between rate and energy.\nEventually linear and super-linear distributed optimization solutions are\nproposed for each problem and their performance are compared in terms of\nconvergence and complexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Nov 2010 14:58:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-24", "authors_parsed": [["Khodaian", "Amir M.", ""], ["Khalaj", "Babak H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.5167", "submitter": "Alex Papalexis", "authors": "Alex Papalexis", "title": "A Coder-Decoder model for use in Lossless Data Compression", "comments": "7 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article describes a technique of using a trigonometric function and\ncombinatorial calculations to code or transform any finite sequence of binary\nnumbers (0s and 1s) of any length to a unique set of three Real numbers.
