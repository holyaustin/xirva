We show that,\nin the limit in which a model complexity constraint is relaxed, filtering finds\nthe exact causal architecture of a stochastic dynamical system, known as the\ncausal-state partition. From this, one can estimate the amount of historical\ninformation the process stores. More generally, causal filtering finds a graded\nmodel-complexity hierarchy of approximations to the causal architecture. Abrupt\nchanges in the hierarchy, as a function of approximation, capture distinct\nscales of structural organization.\n  For nonideal cases with finite data, we show how the correct number of\nunderlying causal states can be found by optimal causal estimation.
