This paper advocates spread spectrum modulation for\ninterstellar communication, motivated by robust immunity to radio-frequency\ninterference (RFI) of technological origin in the vicinity of the receiver\nwhile preserving full detection sensitivity in the presence of natural sources\nof noise. Receiver design for noise immunity alone provides no basis for\nchoosing a signal with any specific character, therefore failing to reduce\nambiguity. By adding RFI to noise immunity as a design objective, the\nconjunction of choice of signal (by the transmitter) together with optimum\ndetection for noise immunity (in the receiver) leads through simple\nprobabilistic argument to the conclusion that the signal should possess the\nstatistical properties of a burst of white noise, and also have a large\ntime-bandwidth product. Thus spread spectrum also provides an implicit\ncoordination between transmitter and receiver by reducing the ambiguity as to\nthe signal character. This strategy requires the receiver to guess the specific\nnoise-like signal, and it is contended that this is feasible if an appropriate\npseudorandom signal is generated algorithmically. For example, conceptually\nsimple algorithms like the binary expansion of common irrational numbers like\nPi are shown to be suitable. Due to its deliberately wider bandwidth, spread\nspectrum is more susceptible to dispersion and distortion in propagation\nthrough the interstellar medium, desirably reducing ambiguity in parameters\nlike bandwidth and carrier frequency.

The SBP\nmessage updates reduce the computational complexity (per iteration) from\nquadratic to linear in $d$, without assuming any particular structure of the\npotentials, and also reduce the communication complexity significantly,\nrequiring only $\\log{d}$ bits transmission per edge. Moreover, we establish a\nnumber of theoretical guarantees for the performance of SBP, showing that it\nconverges almost surely to the BP fixed point for any tree-structured graph,\nand for graphs with cycles satisfying a contractivity condition. In addition,\nfor these graphical models, we provide non-asymptotic upper bounds on the\nconvergence rate, showing that the $\\ell_{\\infty}$ norm of the error vector\ndecays no slower than $O(1/\\sqrt{t})$ with the number of iterations $t$ on\ntrees and the mean square error decays as $O(1/t)$ for general graphs. These\nanalysis show that SBP can provably yield reductions in computational and\ncommunication complexities for various classes of graphical models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Nov 2011 00:28:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 25 May 2012 01:31:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Noorshams", "Nima", ""], ["Wainwright", "Martin J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.1041", "submitter": "Andrea Montanari", "authors": "David Donoho, Iain Johnstone and Andrea Montanari", "title": "Accurate Prediction of Phase Transitions in Compressed Sensing via a\n  Connection to Minimax Denoising", "comments": "71 pages, 32 pdf figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Compressed sensing posits that, within limits, one can undersample a sparse\nsignal and yet reconstruct it accurately.

In this case, a K-transmitter\nsingle-input multiple-output (SIMO) interference channel (IC) is constituted\nafter user selection. Without help of multiuser diversity, K-1 interfering\nsignals cannot be perfectly removed at each user since the number of receive\nantennas is smaller than or equal to the number of interferers. Only with\nproper user selection, non-zero DoF per transmitter is achievable as the number\nof users increases. Through geometric interpretation of interfering channels,\nwe show that the multiuser dimensions have to be used first for reducing the\nDoF loss caused by the interfering signals, and then have to be used for\nincreasing the DoF gain from its own signal. The sufficient number of users for\nthe target DoF is derived. We also discuss how the optimal strategy of\nexploiting multiuser diversity can be realized by practical user selection\nschemes.

First, CF\nwithout binning but with joint decoding of both the message and compression\nindex can achieve a larger rate region than the original CF scheme for\nmulti-destination relay networks. With binning and successive decoding, the\ncompression rate at each relay is constrained by the weakest link from the\nrelay to a destination; but without binning, this constraint is relaxed.\nSecond, simultaneous decoding of all messages over all blocks without uniquely\ndecoding the compression indices can remove the constraints on compression rate\ncompletely, but is still subject to the message block boundary effect. Third,\nmessage repetition is necessary to overcome this boundary effect and achieve\nthe noisy network coding region for multi-source networks. The rate region is\nenlarged with increasing repetition times. We also apply CF without binning\nspecifically to the one-way and two-way relay channels and analyze the rate\nregions in detail. For the one-way relay channel, it achieves the same rate as\nthe original CF and noisy network coding but has only 1 block decoding delay.\nFor the two-way relay channel, we derive the explicit channel conditions in the\nGaussian and fading cases for CF without binning to achieve the same rate\nregion or sum rate as noisy network coding.

Due\nto its generality, and the wide use of Gaussians and Gaussian-mixtures to\nstatistically model several phenomena, this theoretical framework can find\napplications in multiple disciplines, such as communication, estimation, and\ninformation theory, when part of the nonlinear transformation input is the\nquantity of interest and the other part is the noise. In particular, the paper\nshows how the said properties can be exploited to simplify closed-form\ncomputation of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the estimation mean-squared\nerror (MSE), and bounds on the mutual information in additive non-Gaussian\n(possibly non-linear) channels, also establishing relationships among them.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Nov 2011 11:26:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 1 Feb 2012 18:44:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 10 May 2013 15:32:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Banelli", "Paolo", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.6174", "submitter": "David R.

Since methods of combining subjectively assessed probability\ndistributions are not objective enough for that purpose, this paper introduces\na method of distribution combination that does not require any assignment of\ndistribution weights. It does so by formalizing a hedging strategy in terms of\na game between three players: nature, a statistician combining distributions,\nand a statistician refusing to combine distributions. The optimal move of the\nfirst statistician reduces to the solution of a simpler problem of selecting an\nestimating distribution that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler loss maximized over\nthe plausible distributions to be combined. The resulting combined distribution\nis a linear combination of the most extreme of the distributions to be combined\nthat are scientifically plausible.
