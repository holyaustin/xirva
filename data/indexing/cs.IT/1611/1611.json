The linear programming (LP) outer bound of the entropy space\nserves as the starting point of this approach; however, our effort goes\nsignificantly beyond using it to prove information inequalities. We first\nidentify and formalize the symmetry structure in the problem, which enables us\nto show the existence of optimal symmetric solutions. A symmetry-reduced linear\nprogram is then used to identify the boundary of the memory-transmission-rate\ntradeoff for several small cases, for which we obtain a set of tight outer\nbounds. General hypotheses on the optimal tradeoff region are formed from these\ncomputed data, which are then analytically proven. This leads to a complete\ncharacterization of the optimal tradeoff for systems with only two users, and\ncertain partial characterization for systems with only two files. Next, we show\nthat by carefully analyzing the joint entropy structure of the outer bounds for\ncertain cases, a novel code construction can be reverse-engineered, which\neventually leads to a general class of codes. Finally, we show that outer\nbounds can be computed through strategically relaxing the LP in different ways,\nwhich can be used to explore the problem computationally. This allows us\nfirstly to deduce generic characteristic of the converse proof, and secondly to\ncompute outer bounds for larger problem cases, despite the seemingly impossible\ncomputation scale.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Oct 2016 20:11:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 13 Dec 2016 04:12:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 25 Aug 2018 19:40:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-28", "authors_parsed": [["Tian", "Chao", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.00044", "submitter": "Sergey Loyka", "authors": "Sergey Loyka, Charalambos D.

Oftentimes these\nparsimonious signals serve as inputs to computationally-intensive linear\noperators.

This allows resolving\nmultiple users on the same pilot dimension at different sectors, thereby\nincreasing the overall multiplexing gains of the system. Our analysis and\nsimulations reveal that, by using appropriately designed directional training\nbeams at the user terminals, the sector-based transmission schemes we present\ncan yield substantial spatial multiplexing and ergodic user-rates improvements\nwith respect to their orthogonal-training counterparts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Nov 2016 02:40:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 19 Nov 2016 05:35:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 19 May 2017 18:40:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Zheda", ""], ["Rupasinghe", "Nadisanka", ""], ["Bursalioglu", "Ozgun Y.", ""], ["Wang", "Chenwei", ""], ["Papadopoulos", "Haralabos", ""], ["Caire", "Giuseppe", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.00455", "submitter": "Thorsten Wissmann", "authors": "Yusuke Kawamoto, Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis, and Catuscia\n  Palamidessi", "title": "On the Compositionality of Quantitative Information Flow", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Logical Methods in Computer Science, Volume 13, Issue 3 (August\n  15, 2017) lmcs:3860", "doi": "10.23638/LMCS-13(3:11)2017", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Information flow is the branch of security that studies the leakage of\ninformation due to correlation between secrets and observables.

For legacy\nsystems, OOB radiation is well understood and is commonly handled by digital\nprecompensation techniques. When using large arrays, however, new phenomena and\nhardware limitations have to be considered. First, signals can be radiated\ndirectionally, which might focus the OOB radiation. Second, low-complexity\nhardware is used for cost reasons, which increases the relative amount of OOB\nradiation. Given that massive MIMO and millimeter wave communication rely on\nbase stations with a large number of antennas, the spatial behavior of OOB\nradiation from large arrays will have significant implications for the hardware\nrequirements of future base stations. We show that, if the OOB radiation is\nbeamformed, its array gain is never larger than that of the in-band signal. In\nmany cases, the OOB radiation is close to isotropic even when the in-band\nsignal is highly directive. With the same total radiated power, the OOB\nradiation from large arrays is therefore never more severe than from a legacy\nsystem with the same adjacent-channel-leakage ratio. Further, the OOB radiation\nis less detrimental than from a legacy system since the high array gain of the\nin-band signal allows large arrays to radiate less total power than legacy\nsystems. We also show how OOB radiation from large arrays varies with location\nin static propagation environments and how these effects vanish when averaged\nover the small-scale fading. Since a higher relative amount of OOB radiation\ncan be tolerated for large arrays, the linearity requirement can be relaxed as\ncompared to legacy systems. Specifically, less stringent linearity requirements\non each transmitter makes it possible to build large arrays from low-complexity\nhardware.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Nov 2016 13:03:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 Apr 2017 06:28:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-06", "authors_parsed": [["Moll\u00e9n", "Christopher", ""], ["Larsson", "Erik G.", ""], ["Gustavsson", "Ulf", ""], ["Eriksson", "Thomas", ""], ["Heath", "Robert W.", "Jr"]]}, {"id": "1611.01376", "submitter": "Philip Schniter", "authors": "Philip Schniter and Sundeep Rangan and Alyson Fletcher", "title": "Denoising based Vector Approximate Message Passing", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The denoising-based approximate message passing (D-AMP) methodology, recently\nproposed by Metzler, Maleki, and Baraniuk, allows one to plug in sophisticated\ndenoisers like BM3D into the AMP algorithm to achieve state-of-the-art\ncompressive image recovery.

The channels associated with\ndifferent transmitreceive pairs can be highly correlated due to the i) high\nprobability of line-of-sight (LOS) communication between user equipment (UE)\nand base station (BS), and ii) insufficient spacing between antenna elements at\nboth UE and BS. In this paper, we propose a novel transmission technique titled\nDiversity Pulse Shaped Transmission (DPST) to enhance the throughput over the\ncorrelated MIMO channels in an ultra-dense small cell network. The fundamental\nof DPST is to shape transmit signals at adjacent antennas with distinct\ninterpolating filters, introducing pulse shaping diversity. In DPST, each\nantenna transmits its own data stream with a relative deterministic time\noffset-which must be a fraction of the symbol period-with respect to the\nadjacent antenna. The delay is interpolated with the pulse shaped signal\ngenerating a virtual MIMO channel that benefits from increased diversity from\nthe receiver perspective. To extract the diversity, the receiver must operate\nin an over-sampled domain and hence a fractionally spaced equaliser (FSE) is\nproposed. The joint impact of DPST and FSE helps the receiver to sense a less\ncorrelated channel, eventually enhancing the UE's throughput. Moreover, in\norder to minimise the spatial correlation, we aim to optimise the deterministic\nfractional delay. Simulation results show that applying DPST to a correlated\nchannel can approximately enhance the UE throughput by 1.93x and 3.76x in 2x2\nand 4x4 MIMO systems, respectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Nov 2016 20:26:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-08", "authors_parsed": [["Jafari", "Amir H.", ""], ["Venkateswaran", "Vijay", ""], ["Lopez-Perez", "David", ""], ["Zhang", "Jie", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.01579", "submitter": "Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri Mr.", "authors": "Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri, Qianqian Yang, and Deniz Gunduz", "title": "Decentralized Caching and Coded Delivery with Distinct Cache Capacities", "comments": "to appear, IEEE Transactions on Communications", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Decentralized proactive caching and coded delivery is studied in a content\ndelivery network, where each user is equipped with a cache memory, not\nnecessarily of equal capacity.

It is built to transmit chaotic signals generated by a hybrid\ndynamical system and then to filter the received signals by using the\ncorresponding matched filter to decrease the noise effect and to detect the\nbinary information. We find that the multipath effect can be effectively\nresisted by regrouping the return map of the received signal and by setting the\ncorresponding threshold based on the available information. We show that the\noptimal threshold is a function of the channel parameters and of the\ntransmitted information symbols. Practically, the channel parameters are\ntime-variant, and the future information symbols are unavailable. In this case,\na suboptimal threshold (SOT) is proposed, and the BER using the SOT is derived\nanalytically. Simulation results show that the CWCS achieves a remarkable\ncompetitive performance even under inaccurate channel parameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 9 Oct 2016 15:24:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 7 Feb 2017 04:35:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 26 Sep 2017 05:22:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["Yao", "Junliang", ""], ["Li", "Chen", ""], ["Ren", "Haipeng", ""], ["Grebogi", "Celso", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.02336", "submitter": "Duy H.

Our analytical results shed new light\non the dynamic TDD in future synchronous 5G networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Nov 2016 06:11:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Jan 2017 06:49:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 11 Mar 2017 05:43:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 12 Apr 2017 03:00:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sun, 27 Aug 2017 05:20:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Tue, 26 Sep 2017 06:42:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-27", "authors_parsed": [["Ding", "Ming", ""], ["Perez", "David Lopez", ""], ["Mao", "Guoqiang", ""], ["Lin", "Zihuai", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.02836", "submitter": "Yihua Tan", "authors": "Yihua Tan, Soung Chang Liew, and Tao Huang", "title": "Mobile Lattice-Coded Physical-Layer Network Coding With Practical\n  Channel Alignment", "comments": "22 pages, 18 figures, 3 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Physical-layer network coding (PNC) is a communications paradigm that\nexploits overlapped transmissions to boost the throughput of wireless relay\nnetworks. A high point of PNC research was a theoretical proof that PNC that\nmakes use of lattice codes could approach the information-theoretic capacity of\na two-way relay network (TWRN), where two end nodes communicate via a relay\nnode. The capacity cannot be achieved by conventional methods of time-division\nor straightforward network coding. Many practical challenges, however, remain\nto be addressed before the full potential of lattice-coded PNC can be realized.\nTwo major challenges are: for good performance in lattice-coded PNC, channels\nof simultaneously transmitting nodes must be aligned; for lattice-coded PNC to\nbe practical, the complexity of lattice encoding at the transmitters and\nlattice decoding at the receiver must be reduced. We address these challenges\nand implement a first lattice-coded PNC system on a software-defined radio\nplatform. Specifically, we design and implement a low-overhead channel\nprecoding system that accurately aligns the channels of distributed nodes. In\nour implementation, the nodes only use low-cost temperature-compensated\noscillators---a consequent challenge is that the channel alignment must be done\nmore frequently and more accurately compared with the use of expensive\noscillators. The low overhead and accurate channel alignment are achieved by\n(1)a channel precoding system implemented over FPGA to realize fast feedback of\nchannel state information; (2)a highly-accurate carrier frequency offset\nestimation method; and (3)a partial-feedback channel estimation method that\nsignificantly reduces the feedback information from the receiver to the\ntransmitters for channel precoding at the transmitters.

The goal is\nto estimate the calibration parameter $\\boldsymbol{d}$ (resolve the uncertainty\nin the sensing process) and the signal/object of interests $\\boldsymbol{x}$\nsimultaneously. For three different models of practical relevance, we show how\nsuch a \\emph{bilinear} inverse problem, including blind deconvolution as an\nimportant example, can be solved via a simple \\emph{linear least squares}\napproach. As a consequence, the proposed algorithms are numerically extremely\nefficient, thus potentially allowing for real-time deployment. We also present\na variation of the least squares approach, which leads to a~\\emph{spectral\nmethod}, where the solution to the bilinear inverse problem can be found by\ncomputing the singular vector associated with the smallest singular value of a\ncertain matrix derived from the bilinear system. Explicit theoretical\nguarantees and stability theory are derived for both techniques; and the number\nof sampling complexity is nearly optimal (up to a poly-log factor).\nApplications in imaging sciences and signal processing are discussed and\nnumerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and\nefficiency of our approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 13 Nov 2016 21:52:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 31 May 2017 00:01:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 21 Nov 2017 03:45:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-22", "authors_parsed": [["Ling", "Shuyang", ""], ["Strohmer", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.04203", "submitter": "Hessam Mahdavifar", "authors": "Hessam Mahdavifar", "title": "Polar Coding for Non-Stationary Channels", "comments": "accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The problem of polar coding for an arbitrary sequence of independent\nbinary-input memoryless symmetric (BMS) channels $\\left\\{W_i\\right\\}_{i=1}^{N}$\nis considered.

Using the new characterization, the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a form of\nlow-complexity implementation for a minimum mean square error (MMSE) receiver\nare derived. Such an implementation exists under multipath channels if the GFDM\ntransmitter matrix is selected to be unitary.

The FTR model arises as the natural\ngeneralization of the two-wave with diffuse power (TWDP) fading model; this\ngeneralization allows its two specular components to exhibit a random amplitude\nfluctuation. Unlike the TWDP model, all the chief probability functions of the\nFTR fading model (PDF, CDF and MGF) are expressed in closed-form, having a\nfunctional form similar to other state-of-the-art fading models.

We show that the FTR\nfading model provides a much better fit than Rician fading for recent\nsmall-scale fading measurements in 28 GHz outdoor millimeter-wave channels.\nFinally, the performance of wireless communication systems over FTR fading is\nevaluated in terms of the bit error rate and the outage capacity, and the\ninterplay between the FTR fading model parameters and the system performance is\ndiscussed.

The performance of the proposed DSD algorithm is evaluated and\ncompared with existing detection schemes in a realistic scenario with\ndistributed antennas. A sum-rate analysis and a computational cost study for\nDSD are also presented. Simulation results show an excellent performance of the\nproposed DSD algorithm when combined with linear and successive interference\ncancellation detection techniques.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 17 Nov 2016 07:58:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Arevalo", "L.", ""], ["de Lamare", "R.

The main goal is to further refine\ncharacterizations of the optimal rates for quantum source coding, state\nredistribution, and measurement compression with quantum side information via\nsecond order asymptotic expansions and strong converse theorems. The\ndissertation consists of a mathematical and an information-theoretic part. In\nthe mathematical part, we focus on the $\\alpha$-sandwiched R\\'enyi divergence\n($\\alpha$-SRD). We first investigate the limit $\\alpha\\to 0$ to determine\nwhether this recovers the well-known $0$-R\\'enyi relative divergence. We then\nprove various new results for entropic quantities derived from the\n$\\alpha$-SRD, including dimension bounds and useful bounds in terms of the\nfidelity between two quantum states. Furthermore, we derive a necessary and\nsufficient algebraic condition for equality in the data processing inequality\n(viz. monotonicity under quantum operations) for the $\\alpha$-SRD, and give\napplications to entropic bounds. In the information-theoretic part, we first\nderive the second order asymptotics of visible quantum source coding using a\nmixed source. For the achievability part, we develop universal quantum source\ncodes achieving a given second order rate for a memoryless source. As a\ncorollary of the main result, we obtain the second order asymptotics of quantum\nsource coding using a single memoryless source. We then prove strong converse\ntheorems for state redistribution (with or without feedback) and measurement\ncompression with quantum side information. The key ingredients in proving these\ntheorems are the aforementioned fidelity bounds on R\\'enyi entropic quantities\nderived from the $\\alpha$-SRD.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 27 Nov 2016 07:51:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-29", "authors_parsed": [["Leditzky", "Felix", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.08805", "submitter": "Geamel Alyami", "authors": "Waqas Ahmad, Geamel Alyami and Ivica Kostanic", "title": "Multiuser separation and performance analysis of millimeter wave\n  channels with linear precoding", "comments": "IEEE International Conference on Communication, Networks and\n  Satellite (COMNETSAT) (IEEE COMNETSAT 2016)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the conventional multiuser MIMO systems, user selection and scheduling has\npreviously been used as an effective way to increase the sum rate performance\nof the system.

The\ncharacterization of ETSs for irregular codes has been known to be a challenging\nproblem due to the large variety of non-isomorphic ETS structures that can\nexist within the Tanner graph of these codes. This is a direct consequence of\nthe variety of the degrees of the variable nodes that can participate in such\nstructures. The proposed characterization is based on a hierarchical graphical\nrepresentation of ETSs, starting from simple cycles of the graph, or from\nsingle variable nodes, and involves three simple expansion techniques:\ndegree-one tree ($dot$), $path$ and $lollipop$, thus, the terminology {\\em dpl\ncharacterization}. A similar dpl characterization was proposed in an earlier\nwork by the authors for the leafless ETSs (LETSs) of variable-regular LDPC\ncodes. The present paper generalizes the prior work to codes with a variety of\nvariable node degrees and to ETSs that are not leafless. The proposed dpl\ncharacterization corresponds to an efficient search algorithm that, for a given\nirregular LDPC code, can find all the instances of $(a,b)$ ETSs with size $a$\nand with the number of unsatisfied check nodes $b$ within any range of interest\n$a \\leq a_{max}$ and $b \\leq b_{max}$, exhaustively. Although, (brute force)\nexhaustive search algorithms for ETSs of irregular LDPC codes exist, to the\nbest of our knowledge, the proposed search algorithm is the first of its kind,\nin that, it is devised based on a characterization of ETSs that makes the\nsearch process efficient.

Across a variety of datasets, metrics, and\nexperiments, we demonstrate that CorEx produces topics that are comparable in\nquality to those produced by unsupervised and semi-supervised variants of LDA.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Nov 2016 17:32:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 28 Jul 2017 17:41:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 4 Dec 2017 03:53:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 3 Sep 2018 15:23:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Gallagher", "Ryan J.", ""], ["Reing", "Kyle", ""], ["Kale", "David", ""], ["Steeg", "Greg Ver", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.10302", "submitter": "Nadieh Moghadam", "authors": "Nadieh Moghadam, Mohammad Mohebbi and Hongxiang Li", "title": "Opportunistic Scheduling for Network Coded Data in Wireless Multicast\n  Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper queue stability in a single-hop wireless multicast networks\nover erasure channels is analyzed.

Shannon limit typically defines the upper-limit\ncapacity of Nyquist signal. To the best of our knowledge, the mathematical\nexpression for the capacity limit of FTN non-orthogonal frequency-division\nmultiplexing (NOFDM) signal is first demonstrated in this paper. The\nmathematical expression shows that FTN NOFDM signal has the potential to\nachieve a higher capacity limit compared to Nyquist signal. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate the principle of FTN NOFDM by taking fractional cosine\ntransform-based NOFDM (FrCT-NOFDM) for instance. FrCT-NOFDM is first proposed\nand implemented by both simulation and experiment. When the bandwidth\ncompression factor $\\alpha$ is set to $0.8$ in FrCT-NOFDM, the subcarrier\nspacing is equal to $40\\%$ of the symbol rate per subcarrier, thus the\ntransmission rate is about $25\\%$ faster than Nyquist rate. FTN NOFDM with\nhigher capacity would be promising in the future communication systems,\nespecially in the bandwidth-limited applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Nov 2016 18:57:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 10 May 2017 21:55:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 27 Jun 2017 15:13:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-28", "authors_parsed": [["Zhou", "Ji", ""], ["Qiao", "Yaojun", ""], ["Yang", "Zhanyu", ""], ["Guo", "Mengqi", ""], ["Tang", "Xizi", ""]]}]
