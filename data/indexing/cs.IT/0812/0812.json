To achieve this, separate paths have\nto be provisioned to carry encoded packets, hence requiring either the addition\nof extra links, or reserving some of the resources for this purpose.\n  In this paper we introduce autonomic self-healing strategies for autonomic\nnetworks in order to protect against link failures.

In these strategies, an autonomic network is able to\nprovide self-healing from various network failures affecting network operation.\nThe techniques improve service and enhance reliability of autonomic\ncommunication.\n  Network protection codes are extended to provide self-healing from multiple\nlink failures in autonomic networks.
