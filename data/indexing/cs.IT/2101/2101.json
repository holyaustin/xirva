While traditional compressed\nsensing algorithms can be applied to these problems, they suffer high\ncomputational complexity and often require the perfect statistical information\nof channel and devices. This paper solves these problems by designing the\nLearned Approximate Message Passing (LAMP) network, which belongs to\nmodel-driven deep learning approaches and ensures efficient performance without\ntremendous training data. Particularly, in the multiple-antenna scenario, we\ndesign three different LAMP structures, namely, distributed, centralized and\nhybrid ones, to balance the performance and complexity. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed LAMP networks can significantly outperform the\nconventional AMP method thanks to their ability of parameter learning. It is\nalso shown that LAMP has robust performance to the maximal delay spread of the\nasynchronous users.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Jan 2021 16:08:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-05", "authors_parsed": [["Zhu", "Weifeng", ""], ["Tao", "Meixia", ""], ["Yuan", "Xiaojun", ""], ["Guan", "Yunfeng", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.00711", "submitter": "Amirbehshad Shahrasbi", "authors": "Bernhard Haeupler and Amirbehshad Shahrasbi", "title": "Synchronization Strings and Codes for Insertions and Deletions -- a\n  Survey", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.DM cs.DS math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Already in the 1960s, Levenshtein and others studied error-correcting codes\nthat protect against synchronization errors, such as symbol insertions and\ndeletions.

Different from conventional OTFS\ndetection methods, the proposed algorithm applies basic estimation/detection\napproaches to both the time domain and delay-Doppler (DD) domain and\niteratively updates the extrinsic information from two domains with the unitary\ntransformation. In doing so, the proposed algorithm exploits the time domain\nchannel sparsity and the DD domain symbol constellation constraints. We\nevaluate the estimation/detection error variance in each domain for each\niteration and derive the state evolution to investigate the detection error\nperformance. We show that the performance gain due to iterations comes from the\nnon-Gaussian constellation constraint in the DD domain. More importantly, we\nprove the proposed algorithm can indeed converge and, in the convergence, the\nproposed algorithm can achieve almost the same error performance as the\nmaximum-likelihood sequence detection even in the presence of fractional\nDoppler shifts.

Many algorithms have been developed over the past half\ncentury. Recent advances in deep learning have opened up a new possibility for\nrobust and fast PR. An emerging technique, called deep unfolding, provides a\nsystematic connection between conventional model-based iterative algorithms and\nmodern data-based deep learning. Unfolded algorithms, powered by data learning,\nhave shown remarkable performance and convergence speed improvement over the\noriginal algorithms. Despite their potential, most existing unfolded algorithms\nare strictly confined to a fixed number of iterations when employing\nlayer-dependent parameters. In this study, we develop a novel framework for\ndeep unfolding to overcome the existing limitations.

In particular, we introduce a hypernetwork to\ngenerate the damping factors for GEC-SR. Instead of directly learning a set of\noptimal damping factors, the hypernetwork learns how to generate the optimal\ndamping factors according to the clinical settings, thus ensuring its\nadaptivity to different scenarios. To make the hypernetwork work adapt to\nvarying layer numbers, we use a recurrent architecture to develop a dynamic\nhypernetwork, which generates a damping factor that can vary online across\nlayers.

The second is Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA)\nbased on multi-antenna Rate-Splitting (RS) and SIC. We show that there is some\nconfusion about the benefits of NOMA, and we dispel the associated\nmisconceptions. First, we highlight why NOMA is inefficient in multi-antenna\nsettings based on basic multiplexing gain analysis. We stress that the issue\nlies in how the NOMA literature has been hastily applied to multi-antenna\nsetups, resulting in a misuse of spatial dimensions and therefore loss in\nmultiplexing gains and rate. Second, we show that NOMA incurs a severe\nmultiplexing gain loss despite an increased receiver complexity due to an\ninefficient use of SIC receivers. Third, we emphasize that much of the merits\nof NOMA are due to the constant comparison to OMA instead of comparing it to\nMULP and RS baselines. We then expose the pivotal design constraint that\nmulti-antenna NOMA requires one user to fully decode the messages of the other\nusers. This design constraint is responsible for the multiplexing gain erosion,\nrate loss, and inefficient use of SIC receivers in multi-antenna settings. Our\nresults confirm that NOMA should not be applied blindly to multi-antenna\nsettings, highlight the scenarios where MULP outperforms NOMA and vice versa,\nand demonstrate the inefficiency, performance loss and complexity disadvantages\nof NOMA compared to RS. The first takeaway message is that, while NOMA is not\nbeneficial in most multi-antenna deployments. The second takeaway message is\nthat other non-orthogonal transmission frameworks, such as RS, exist which\nfully exploit the multiplexing gain and the benefits of SIC to boost the rate\nin multi-antenna settings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Jan 2021 23:24:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-14", "authors_parsed": [["Clerckx", "Bruno", ""], ["Mao", "Yijie", ""], ["Schober", "Robert", ""], ["Jorswieck", "Eduard", ""], ["Love", "David J.", ""], ["Yuan", "Jinhong", ""], ["Hanzo", "Lajos", ""], ["Li", "Geoffrey Ye", ""], ["Larsson", "Erik G.", ""], ["Caire", "Giuseppe", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.04810", "submitter": "Bruno Clerckx", "authors": "Bruno Clerckx, Kaibin Huang, Lav R.

Such configuration brings a new trade-off among scheduling UDs\nto transmitting UDs, selecting the coding decisions and the transmission\nrate/power. Therefore, we consider the completion time minimization problem\nthat involves scheduling multiple transmitting UDs, determining their\ntransmission rates/powers and file combinations.

We note that our bounds are tight for the case when $d=1$\n(see Sabag et al.

Specifically, we consider a multi-agent partially\nobservable Markov decision process (MA-POMDP), in which the agents, in addition\nto interacting with the environment can also communicate with each other over a\nnoisy communication channel. The noisy communication channel is considered\nexplicitly as part of the dynamics of the environment and the message each\nagent sends is part of the action that the agent can take. As a result, the\nagents learn not only to collaborate with each other but also to communicate\n\"effectively\" over a noisy channel. This framework generalizes both the\ntraditional communication problem, where the main goal is to convey a message\nreliably over a noisy channel, and the \"learning to communicate\" framework that\nhas received recent attention in the MARL literature, where the underlying\ncommunication channels are assumed to be error-free. We show via examples that\nthe joint policy learned using the proposed framework is superior to that where\nthe communication is considered separately from the underlying MA-POMDP.

We construct codes which are real-time oblivious, but\nrequire fewer feedback messages and have faster decoding compared to previous\nwork. Specifically, for a message of length $k'$, we improve the expected\ncomplexity of the feedback channel from $O(\\sqrt{k'})$ to $O(1)$, and the\nexpected decoding complexity from $O(k'\\log(k'))$ to $O(k')$. Our method\ninvolves using an appropriate block erasure code to first encode the $k'$\nmessage symbols, and then using a truncated version of the real-time oblivious\nerasure correction of Beimel et al (2007) to transmit the encoded message to\nthe receiver, which then uses the decoding algorithm for the outer code to\nrecover the message.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Jan 2021 23:58:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-28", "authors_parsed": [["Silas", "Shashwat", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.11139", "submitter": "Amin Gohari", "authors": "Abbas El Gamal, Amin Gohari and Chandra Nair", "title": "A Strengthened Cutset Upper Bound on the Capacity of the Relay Channel\n  and Applications", "comments": "35 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We develop a new upper bound on the capacity of the relay channel that is\ntighter than all previous bounds.
