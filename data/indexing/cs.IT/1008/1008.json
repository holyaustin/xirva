Also, if new nodes join the entire network code may have\nto be redesigned.\n  In this work, we present the first universal and robust distributed linear\nnetwork coding schemes. Our schemes are universal since they are independent of\nall network parameters. They are robust since if nodes join or leave, the\nremaining nodes do not need to change their coding operations and the receivers\ncan still decode. They are distributed since nodes need only have topological\ninformation about the part of the network upstream of them, which can be\nnaturally streamed as part of the communication protocol.\n  We present both probabilistic and deterministic schemes that are all\nasymptotically rate-optimal in the coding block-length, and have guarantees of\ncorrectness. Our probabilistic designs are computationally efficient, with\norder-optimal complexity. Our deterministic designs guarantee zero error\ndecoding, albeit via codes with high computational complexity in general. Our\ncoding schemes are based on network codes over ``scalable fields\". Instead of\nchoosing coding coefficients from one field at every node, each node uses\nlinear coding operations over an ``effective field-size\" that depends on the\nnode's distance from the source node.

Although the reduced problems still have exponential complexity,\nunlike prior works on such problems, our greedy algorithms are simple to use\nand do not require solving any linear programs. Further, using the insight\nobtained from the optimal solution to a line network, we propose two simple\nheuristics that can be implemented in polynomial time and in a distributed\nfashion and compare them with the optimal solution. Simulations suggest that\nboth heuristics perform very close to the optimal solution over random network\ntopologies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 Aug 2010 01:44:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 9 Mar 2011 04:02:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 9 Apr 2011 02:22:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 16 Oct 2011 22:00:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-18", "authors_parsed": [["Urgaonkar", "Rahul", ""], ["Neely", "Michael J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.4957", "submitter": "X.

For a\nstochastic system, its relative entropy $D$ evolves in accordance with the\nsecond law of thermodynamics; its absolute entropy $H$ may also be so, provided\nthat the stochastic perturbation is additive and the flow of the vector field\nis nondivergent. For a deterministic system, $dH/dt$ is equal to the\nmathematical expectation of the divergence of the flow (a result obtained\nbefore), and, remarkably, $dD/dt = 0$. That is to say, relative entropy is\nalways conserved. So, for a nonlinear system, though the trajectories of the\nstate variables, say $\\ve x$, may appear chaotic in the phase space, say\n$\\Omega$, those of the density function $\\rho(\\ve x)$ in the new ``phase\nspace'' $L^1(\\Omega)$ are not; the corresponding Lyapunov exponent is always\nzero.

To increase versatility towards the usage of the\navailable information, the present manuscript extends the Adaptive Projected\nSubgradient Method (APSM) by introducing an algorithmic scheme which\nincorporates a-priori knowledge in the design via a sequence of strongly\nattracting quasi-nonexpansive mappings in a real Hilbert space. In such a way,\nthe benefits offered to online learning tasks by the proposed method unfold in\ntwo ways: 1) the rich class of quasi-nonexpansive mappings provides a plethora\nof ways to cast a-priori knowledge, and 2) by introducing a sequence of such\nmappings, the proposed scheme is able to capture the time-varying nature of\na-priori information.
