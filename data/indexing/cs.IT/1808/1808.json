We study the joint design of\nthe three-dimensional (3D) aerial trajectory and the wireless resource\nallocation for maximization of the system sum throughput over a given time\nperiod. As a performance benchmark, we first consider an offline resource\nallocation design assuming non-causal knowledge of the channel gains. The\nalgorithm design is formulated as a mixed-integer non-convex optimization\nproblem taking into account the aerodynamic power consumption, solar energy\nharvesting, a finite energy storage capacity, and the quality-of-service (QoS)\nrequirements of the users. Despite the non-convexity of the optimization\nproblem, we solve it optimally by applying monotonic optimization to obtain the\noptimal 3D-trajectory and the optimal power and subcarrier allocation policy.\nSubsequently, we focus on online algorithm design which only requires real-time\nand statistical knowledge of the channel gains. The optimal online resource\nallocation algorithm is motivated by the offline scheme and entails a high\ncomputational complexity. Hence, we also propose a low-complexity iterative\nsuboptimal online scheme based on successive convex approximation. Our results\nunveil the tradeoff between solar energy harvesting and power-efficient\ncommunication. In particular, the solar-powered UAV first climbs up to a high\naltitude to harvest a sufficient amount of solar energy and then descents again\nto a lower altitude to reduce the path loss of the communication links to the\nusers it serves.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jul 2018 22:47:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Sun", "Yan", ""], ["Xu", "Dongfang", ""], ["Ng", "Derrick Wing Kwan", ""], ["Dai", "Linglong", ""], ["Schober", "Robert", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.00135", "submitter": "Mark Wilde", "authors": "Mario Berta, Fernando G.

Due to the high UAV\naltitude, the channels between UAVs and the ground base stations (GBSs) are\ndominated by the strong line-of-sight (LoS) links, thus severe interference may\nbe generated to/from the GBSs in the uplink/downlink, which renders the\ninterference management with coexisting terrestrial and aerial users a more\nchallenging problem to solve. In this paper, we study the uplink communication\nfrom a multi-antenna UAV to a set of GBSs in its signal coverage region. Among\nthese GBSs, we denote available GBSs as the ones that do not serve any\nterrestrial users at the assigned resource block (RB) of the UAV, and occupied\nGBSs as the rest that are serving their respectively associated terrestrial\nusers in the same RB. We propose a new cooperative interference cancellation\nstrategy for the multi-beam UAV uplink communication, which aims to eliminate\nthe co-channel interference at each of the occupied GBSs and in the meanwhile\nmaximize the sum-rate to the available GBSs. Specifically, the multi-antenna\nUAV sends multiple data streams to selected available GBSs, which in turn\nforward their decoded data streams to their backhaul-connected occupied GBSs\nfor interference cancellation. To draw useful insights, the maximum\ndegrees-of-freedom (DoF) achievable by the multi-beam UAV communication for\nsum-rate maximization in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime is first\ncharacterized, subject to the stringent constraint that all the occupied GBSs\ndo not suffer from any interference in the UAV's uplink transmission.

The objective is to construct a\nlossless source code that maps $X^n$ to a sequence $\\widehat{Y}^m$ of length\n$m$ that is indistinguishable, in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence, from a\nsequence emitted by another DMS with known distribution $p_Y$. The main result\nis the existence of a coding scheme that performs this task with an optimal\nratio $m/n$ equal to $H(X)/H(Y)$, the ratio of the Shannon entropies of the two\ndistributions, as $n$ goes to infinity. The coding scheme overcomes the\nchallenges created by the lack of knowledge about $p_X$ by a type-based\nuniversal lossless source coding scheme that produces as output an almost\nuniformly distributed sequence, followed by another type-based coding scheme\nthat jointly performs source resolvability and universal lossless source\ncoding. The result recovers and extends previous results that either assume\n$p_X$ or $p_Y$ uniform, or $p_X$ known. The price paid for these\ngeneralizations is the use of common randomness with vanishing rate, whose\nlength scales as the logarithm of $n$. By allowing common randomness larger\nthan the logarithm of $n$ but still negligible compared to $n$, a constructive\nlow-complexity encoding and decoding counterpart to the main result is also\nprovided for binary sources by means of polar codes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 16 Aug 2018 17:59:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 17 Jun 2021 18:31:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-21", "authors_parsed": [["Chou", "Remi A.", ""], ["Bloch", "Matthieu R.", ""], ["Yener", "Aylin", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.05647", "submitter": "Rafael Gregorio Lucas D'Oliveira", "authors": "Rafael G.L.

Both types of codebook are\nconstructed from 2-D DFT based grid of beams, and enable the CSI feedback of\nbeam selection as well as PSK based co-phase combining between two\npolarizations. Moreover, Type-2 codebook based CSI feedback reports the\nwideband and subband amplitude information of the selected beams. As a result,\nit is envisioned that more accurate CSI shall be obtained from the Type-2\ncodebook based CSI feedback so that better precoded MIMO transmission can be\nemployed by the network. To reduce the CSI feedback signaling, 1 bit based\nsubband amplitude with only two quantization levels is supported in combination\nto 3 bits based wideband amplitude feedback. Typically, wideband amplitude\nshall be calculated as the linear average amplitude of the beam over all\nsubbands. However, due to the coarse subband amplitude quantization, it has\nbeen observed in case of joint wideband and subband amplitude feedback, the\naverage based wideband amplitude can lead to a large amplitude quantization\nerrors. In this paper, we study two methods for joint wideband and subband\namplitude calculations. Specifically, both optimal and sub-optimal methods are\nproposed. The optimal method can achieve the minimum amplitude quantization\nerrors at the cost of a relatively large computation complexity. And by virtue\nof a derived scaling factor, the sub-optimal method exhibits clearly smaller\nquantization error than the conventional linear average based method especially\nfor the channel with large frequency selectivity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Aug 2018 11:51:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-21", "authors_parsed": [["Miao", "Honglei", ""], ["Mueck", "Markus D.", ""], ["Faerber", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.06449", "submitter": "Anurag Anshu", "authors": "Anurag Anshu and Penghui Yao", "title": "On the compression of messages in the multi-party setting", "comments": "version 1, 34 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory ( Volume: 66 , Issue: 4 ,\n  April 2020 )", "doi": "10.1109/TIT.2020.2965114", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the following communication task in the multi-party setting,\nwhich involves a joint random variable $XYZMN$ with the property that $M$ is\nindependent of $YZN$ conditioned on $X$ and $N$ is independent of $XZM$\nconditioned on $Y$.

However, to implement the MEP analysis, a sufficiently long-time data\nrecording in general is often required, e.g., hours of spiking recordings of\nneurons in neuronal networks. The issue of whether the MEP analysis can be\nsuccessfully applied to network systems with data from short recordings has yet\nto be fully addressed. In this work, we investigate relationships underlying\nthe probability distributions, moments, and effective interactions in the MEP\nanalysis and then show that, with short recordings of network dynamics, the MEP\nanalysis can be applied to reconstructing probability distributions of network\nstates under the condition of asynchronous activity of nodes in the network.\nUsing spike trains obtained from both Hodgkin-Huxley neuronal networks and\nelectrophysiological experiments, we verify our results and demonstrate that\nMEP analysis provides a tool to investigate the neuronal population coding\nproperties, even for short recordings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Aug 2018 20:28:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-27", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Zhi-Qin John", ""], ["Crodelle", "Jennifer", ""], ["Zhou", "Douglas", ""], ["Cai", "David", ""]]}]
