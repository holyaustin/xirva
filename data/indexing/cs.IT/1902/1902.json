Each receiver requests an\narbitrary file from the library. The objective is to design a cache placement\nwithout knowing the receivers' requests and a communication scheme such that\nthe sum Degrees of Freedom (sum-DoF) of the delivery is maximized.

For this reason a novel algorithmic framework that\nincorporates SI into AMP, referred to as approximate message passing with side\ninformation (AMP-SI), has been recently introduced. An attractive feature of\nAMP is that when the elements of the signal are exchangeable, the entries of\nthe measurement matrix are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)\nGaussian, and the denoiser applies the same non-linearity at each entry, the\nperformance of AMP can be predicted accurately by a scalar iteration referred\nto as state evolution (SE). However, the AMP-SI framework uses different\nentry-wise scalar denoisers, based on the entry-wise level of the SI, and\ntherefore is not supported by the standard AMP theory. In this work, we provide\nrigorous performance guarantees for AMP-SI when the input signal and SI are\ndrawn i.i.d. according to some joint distribution subject to finite moment\nconstraints. Moreover, we provide numerical examples to support the theory\nwhich demonstrate empirically that the SE can predict the AMP-SI mean square\nerror accurately.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Feb 2019 02:10:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 6 May 2019 00:15:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-07", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Hangjin", ""], ["Rush", "Cynthia", ""], ["Baron", "Dror", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.00167", "submitter": "Minchul Kim", "authors": "Minchul Kim and Jungwoo Lee", "title": "Private Secure Coded Computation", "comments": "6 pages, 3 figures, submitted to ISIT 2019", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce a variation of coded computation that ensures data security and\nmaster's privacy against workers, which is referred to as private secure coded\ncomputation.

Recently, an interesting connection between the\nage of information and remote estimation error was found in a sampling problem\nof Wiener processes: If the sampler has no knowledge of the signal being\nsampled, the optimal sampling strategy is to minimize the age of information;\nhowever, by exploiting causal knowledge of the signal values, it is possible to\nachieve a smaller estimation error. In this paper, we extend a previous study\nby investigating a problem of sampling a stationary Gauss-Markov process,\nnamely the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. The optimal sampling problem is\nformulated as a constrained continuous-time Markov decision process (MDP) with\nan uncountable state space.

Further, if the sampler has no knowledge of the OU\nprocess, the optimal sampling problem reduces to an MDP for minimizing a\nnonlinear age of information metric. The age-optimal sampling policy is a\nthreshold policy on expected estimation error and the threshold is found.

Thus there is a huge gap between the existing theoretical\nliterature and practical experiments. In this paper we take a step towards\nclosing this gap. Focusing on shallow neural nets and smooth activations, we\nshow that (stochastic) gradient descent when initialized at random converges at\na geometric rate to a nearby global optima as soon as the square-root of the\nnumber of network parameters exceeds the size of the training data. Our results\nalso benefit from a fast convergence rate and continue to hold for\nnon-differentiable activations such as Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Feb 2019 23:42:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-14", "authors_parsed": [["Oymak", "Samet", ""], ["Soltanolkotabi", "Mahdi", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.04677", "submitter": "Yongpeng  Wu", "authors": "Juening Jin, Chengshan Xiao, Wen Chen, and Yongpeng Wu", "title": "Channel-Statistics-Based Hybrid Precoding for Millimeter-Wave MIMO\n  Systems With Dynamic Subarrays", "comments": "Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Communications", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper investigates the hybrid precoding design for millimeter wave\n(mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with finite-alphabet\ninputs.

To address these issues, this study first presents a simple\ncriterion and the corresponding low complexity algorithm to design the optimal\npartition of antennas using statistical CSI.

The IRS (ITS) consists of a large\nnumber of low-cost and energy-efficient passive antenna elements which are able\nto reflect (transmit) a phase-shifted version of the incident electromagnetic\nfield. Similar to lens array (LA) antennas, IRS/ITS-aided antenna architectures\nare energy efficient due to the almost lossless over-the-air connection between\nthe active antennas and the intelligent surface. However, unlike for LA\nantennas, for which the number of active antennas has to linearly grow with the\nnumber of passive elements (i.e., the lens aperture) due to the\nnon-reconfigurablility (i.e., non-intelligence) of the lens, for IRS/ITS-aided\nantennas, the reconfigurablility of the IRS/ITS facilitates scaling up the\nnumber of radiating passive elements without increasing the number of costly\nand bulky active antennas. We show that the constraints that the precoders for\nIRS/ITS-aided antennas have to meet differ from those of conventional MIMO\narchitectures.

In this\npaper, we propose a hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ)-based real-time\nremote estimation framework for linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamic systems.\nConsidering the estimation quality of such a system, there is a fundamental\ntradeoff between the reliability and freshness of the sensor's measurement\ntransmission. When a failed transmission occurs, the sensor can either\nretransmit the previous old measurement such that the receiver can obtain a\nmore reliable old measurement, or transmit a new but less reliable measurement.\nTo design the optimal decision, we formulate a new problem to optimize the\nsensor's online decision policy, i.e., to retransmit or not, depending on both\nthe current estimation quality of the remote estimator and the current number\nof retransmissions of the sensor, so as to minimize the long-term remote\nestimation mean-squared error (MSE). This problem is non-trivial. In\nparticular, it is not clear what the condition is in terms of the communication\nchannel quality and the LTI system parameters, to ensure that the long-term\nestimation MSE can be bounded.

In such cases, the DT\ninterference is an almost cyclostationary process. In this work we characterize\nthe capacity of channels in which the noise arises from a sampled\ncyclostationary Gaussian process. For the case of synchronous sampling,\ncapacity can be obtained in closed form. When sampling is not synchronized with\nthe symbol rate of the interference, the resulting channel is not information\nstable, thus classic tools are not applicable. Using information spectrum\nmethods, we prove that capacity can be obtained as the limit of a sequence of\ncapacities of channels with cyclostationary noise. Our results characterize the\neffects of changes in the sampling rate and sampling time offset on the\ncapacity of the resulting DT channel. In particular, we demonstrate that minor\nvariations in the sampling period can substantially affect capacity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Feb 2019 20:04:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 17 Oct 2019 15:48:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-18", "authors_parsed": [["Shlezinger", "Nir", ""], ["Abakasanga", "Emeka", ""], ["Dabora", "Ron", ""], ["Eldar", "Yonina C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.09040", "submitter": "Christopher Brislawn", "authors": "Christopher M.

Selecting the winning codeword from\nthe decoder's list based on maximum-likelihood (ML) rather than PM. 2.)\nUtilizing statistical knowledge about the reliability of bit estimates in each\ndecoding step to improve list management. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour techniques in simulations. In particular, our enhancements prove useful in\nthe low code rate regime, where theory available in the literature predicts\npronounced losses caused by quantization. Furthermore, we put our work into\nperspective by comparing it to finer quantization and partially unquantized\nschemes. This yields insights and recommendations as to which quantization\nschemes offer the best cost-benefit ratio for practical implementation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Feb 2019 08:55:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-28", "authors_parsed": [["Neu", "Joachim", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.10477", "submitter": "Joel Kabore", "authors": "Jo\\\"el Kabore, Alexandre Fotue-Tabue, Kenza Guenda, Mohammed E.\n  Charkani", "title": "Skew-constacyclic codes over\n  $\\frac{\\mathbb{F}_q[v]}{\\langle\\,v^q-v\\,\\rangle}$", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.AC math.IT math.RA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, the investigation on the algebraic structure of the ring\n$\\frac{\\mathbb{F}_q[v]}{\\langle\\,v^q-v\\,\\rangle}$ and the description of its\nautomorphism group, enable to study the algebraic structure of codes and their\ndual over this ring.

We show, however, that bad conditioning\nonly arises for very small noise levels: Under mild assumptions that include\nmany realistic noise levels we derive near-optimal error estimates for blind\ndeconvolution under adversarial noise.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Feb 2019 15:30:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 12 Mar 2019 16:29:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 9 Apr 2020 20:02:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-13", "authors_parsed": [["Krahmer", "Felix", ""], ["St\u00f6ger", "Dominik", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.11231", "submitter": "Homa Nikbakht", "authors": "Homa Nikbakht, Mich\\`ele Wigger and Shlomo Shamai (Shitz)", "title": "Multiplexing Gain Region of Sectorized Cellular Networks with Mixed\n  Delay Constraints", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The sectorized hexagonal model with mixed delay constraints is considered\nwhen both neighbouring mobile users and base stations can cooperate over\nrate-limited links.

All the access points (APs) in the network cooperate to jointly\nand coherently serve a smaller number of users in the same time-frequency\nresource. However, this coordination needs significant amounts of control\nsignalling which introduces additional overhead, while data co-processing\nincreases the back/front-haul requirements. Hence, the notion that the \"whole\nworld\" could constitute one network, and that all APs would act as a single\nbase station, is not scalable. In this study, we address some system\nscalability aspects of cell-free massive MIMO that have been neglected in\nliterature until now. In particular, we propose and evaluate a solution related\nto data processing, network topology and power control. Results indicate that\nour proposed framework achieves full scalability at the cost of a modest\nperformance loss compared to the canonical form of cell-free massive MIMO.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Feb 2019 18:27:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 6 Sep 2019 17:28:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-09", "authors_parsed": [["Interdonato", "Giovanni", ""], ["Frenger", "P\u00e5l", ""], ["Larsson", "Erik G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.11294", "submitter": "Vincent Corlay", "authors": "Vincent Corlay, Joseph J.
