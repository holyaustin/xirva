Using tools from stochastic\ngeometry, the evaluation of the coverage performance in a two-tier mmWave HCN\nis provided. Since the exact formulation of distance distribution, association\nprobability and coverage probability based on PHP modeling of SBSs is not\nknown, fairly accurate expressions for them are derived and validated by\nsimulation results.

However, due to its limited\ncapacity, the wireless network may not be able to meet the delay requirements\nof such 360 content transmissions. To meet the VR delay requirements, the UAVs\ncan extract specific visible content (e.g., user field of view) from the\noriginal 360 data and send this visible content to the users so as to reduce\nthe traffic load over backhaul and radio access links. To further alleviate the\nUAV-SBS backhaul traffic, the SBSs can also cache the popular contents that\nusers request. This joint content caching and transmission problem is\nformulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the users'\nreliability, defined as the probability that the content transmission delay of\neach user satisfies the instantaneous VR delay target.

If the Gram matrix satisfies certain coherence\nconditions with parameter $\\nu$, the main result shows that the underlying\nconfiguration of $n$ points can be recovered with very high probability from\n$O(nr\\nu\\log^{2}(n))$ uniformly random samples.

Our recovery approach is based on a simple convex program which\nuses the hinge loss function as data fidelity term. While such a risk\nminimization strategy is very natural to learn binary output models, such as in\nclassification, its capacity to estimate a specific signal vector is largely\nunexplored. A major difficulty is that the hinge loss is just piecewise linear,\nso that its \"curvature energy\" is concentrated in a single point. This is\nsubstantially different from other popular loss functions considered in signal\nestimation, e.g., the square or logistic loss, which are at least locally\nstrongly convex. It is therefore somewhat unexpected that we can still prove\nvery similar types of recovery guarantees for the hinge loss estimator, even in\nthe presence of strong noise. More specifically, our non-asymptotic error\nbounds show that stable and robust reconstruction of $x_0$ can be achieved with\nthe optimal oversampling rate $O(m^{-1/2})$ in terms of the number of\nmeasurements $m$. Moreover, we permit a wide class of structural assumptions on\nthe ground truth signal, in the sense that $x_0$ can belong to an arbitrary\nbounded convex set $K \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$.

Service heterogeneity can be accommodated\nby network slicing, through which each service is allocated resources to\nprovide performance guarantees and isolation from the other services. Slicing\nof the Radio Access Network (RAN) is typically done by means of orthogonal\nresource allocation among the services. This work studies the potential\nadvantages of allowing for non-orthogonal sharing of RAN resources in uplink\ncommunications from a set of eMBB, mMTC and URLLC devices to a common base\nstation. The approach is referred to as Heterogeneous Non-Orthogonal Multiple\nAccess (H-NOMA), in contrast to the conventional NOMA techniques that involve\nusers with homogeneous requirements and hence can be investigated through a\nstandard multiple access channel. The study devises a communication-theoretic\nmodel that accounts for the heterogeneous requirements and characteristics of\nthe three services. The concept of reliability diversity is introduced as a\ndesign principle that leverages the different reliability requirements across\nthe services in order to ensure performance guarantees with non-orthogonal RAN\nslicing.

We first choose a subset\nof nodes and then, for each node of the subset, we compute random linear\ncombinations of signal coefficients localized at the node itself and its\nneighborhood. The proposed method provides theoretical guarantees in terms of\nreconstruction and stability to noise for any graph and any orthonormal basis,\neven when the support is not known.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Apr 2018 12:00:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 6 Sep 2018 08:01:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 29 May 2019 09:14:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Valsesia", "Diego", ""], ["Fracastoro", "Giulia", ""], ["Magli", "Enrico", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.06258", "submitter": "Yu Liu", "authors": "Yu Liu and Jiahui Li and Yin Sun and Shidong Zhou", "title": "Joint Beam and Channel Tracking for Two-Dimensional Phased Antenna\n  Arrays", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "eess.SP cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Analog beamforming is a low-cost architecture for millimeter-wave (mmWave)\nmobile communications.

A measure of channel hardening is derived through\nthe coefficient of variation of the channel gain. Our analyses and closed form\nresults based on the used physical model are consistent with those of the\nliterature relying on more abstract Rayleigh fading models, but offer further\ninsights on the relationship with channel characteristics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Apr 2018 08:44:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-23", "authors_parsed": [["Roy", "Matthieu", "", "IRT b-com"], ["Paquelet", "St\u00e9phane", "", "IRT b-com"], ["Magoarou", "Luc Le", "", "IRT b-com"], ["Crussi\u00e8re", "Matthieu", "", "IETR, IRT b-com"]]}, {"id": "1804.07529", "submitter": "Luc Le Magoarou", "authors": "Luc Le Magoarou (IRT b-com), St\\'ephane Paquelet (IRT b-com)", "title": "Bias-variance tradeoff in MIMO channel estimation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "eess.SP cs.IT cs.NI math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Channel estimation is challenging in multi-antenna communication systems,\nbecause of the large number of parameters to estimate.

Through numerical\nsimulation, it is shown that the optimal block length also guarantees good\nperformance in terms of the Mean Square Error (MSE) and Bit Error-Rate (BER)\ncriterion.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Apr 2018 11:09:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-25", "authors_parsed": [["Munir", "Jawad", ""], ["Plabst", "Daniel", ""], ["Nossek", "Josef A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.08955", "submitter": "Diego Napp", "authors": "P.

Numerical results show that, in CoMP JT, RSMA achieves significant\nWSR improvement over SDMA and NOMA in a wide range of inter-user and inter-cell\nchannel strength disparities. Specifically, SDMA (resp. NOMA) is more suited to\ndeployments with little (resp. large) inter-user channel strength disparity and\nlarge (resp. little) inter-cell channel disparity, while RSMA is suited to any\ndeployment. We conclude that RSMA provides rate, robustness and QoS\nenhancements over SDMA and NOMA in CoMP JT networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Apr 2018 14:01:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 17 Jan 2019 03:00:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-18", "authors_parsed": [["Mao", "Yijie", ""], ["Clerckx", "Bruno", ""], ["Li", "Victor O.

Unfortunately, the existing techniques have their own limitations.

To address this issue, this paper presents a\nnovel HV-sensing technology that exploits multi-path transmission from a HV to\na sensing vehicle (SV). The powerful technology enables the SV to detect\nmultiple HV-state parameters including position, orientation of driving\ndirection, and size.

Our design approach leverages estimated information on multi-path\n(AoA/AoD/ToA) and their geometric relations. As a result, a complex system of\nequations or optimization problems, where the desired HV-state parameters are\nvariables, can be formulated for different channel-noise conditions. The\ndevelopment of intelligent solution methods ranging from least-square estimator\nto disk/box minimization yields a set of practical HV-sensing techniques.

We use the sub-6 GHz channel covariance as an out-of-band side\ninformation for mmWave link configuration. Assuming: (i) a fully digital\narchitecture at sub-6 GHz; and (ii) a hybrid analog-digital architecture at\nmmWave, we propose an out-of-band covariance translation approach and an\nout-of-band aided compressed covariance estimation approach. For covariance\ntranslation, we estimate the parameters of sub-6 GHz covariance and use them in\ntheoretical expressions of covariance matrices to predict the mmWave\ncovariance. For out-of-band aided covariance estimation, we use weighted sparse\nsignal recovery to incorporate out-of-band information in compressed covariance\nestimation. The out-of-band covariance translation eliminates the in-band\ntraining completely, whereas out-of-band aided covariance estimation relies on\nin-band as well as out-of-band training. We also analyze the loss in the\nsignal-to-noise ratio due to an imperfect estimate of the covariance. The\nsimulation results show that the proposed covariance estimation strategies can\nreduce the training overhead compared to the in-band only covariance\nestimation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Apr 2018 18:31:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Ali", "Anum", ""], ["Gonz\u00e1lez-Prelcic", "Nuria", ""], ["Heath", "Robert W.", "Jr"]]}]
