The method involves two steps: i) side-information learning and ii)\nspace-time relay transmission. In the first step, different sets of users are\nscheduled to send signals over networks and the remaining users and relays\noverhear the transmitted signals, thereby learning the interference patterns.\nIn the second step, multiple relays cooperatively send out linear combinations\nof signals received in the previous phase using space-time precoding so that\nall users efficiently exploit their side-information in the form of: 1) what\nthey sent and 2) what they overheard in decoding. This coding concept is\nillustrated through two simple network examples. It is shown that ST-PNC\nimproves the sum of degrees of freedom (sum-DoF) of the network compared to\nexisting interference management methods. With ST-PNC, the sum-DoF of a general\nmulti-way relay network without channel knowledge at the users is characterized\nin terms of relevant system parameters, chiefly the number of users, the number\nof relays, and the number of antennas at relays. A major implication of the\nderived results is that efficiently harnessing both transmit- ted and overheard\nsignals as side-information brings significant performance improvements to\nfully-connected multi-way relay networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Apr 2014 20:43:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 15 Oct 2014 19:59:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-16", "authors_parsed": [["Lee", "Namyoon", ""], ["Heath", "Robert W.", "Jr"]]}, {"id": "1405.0032", "submitter": "Namyoon Lee", "authors": "Namyoon Lee, Ravi Tandon, and Robert W.

With the proposed method, achievable trade-offs between the sum of\ndegrees of freedom (sum-DoF) and feedback delay of CSI are characterized in\nboth the X-channel and three-user interference channel to reveal the impact on\nhow the CSI feedback delay affects the sum-DoF of the interference networks. A\nmajor implication of derived results is that distributed and moderately-\ndelayed CSIT is useful to strictly improve the sum-DoF over the case of no CSI\nat the transmitter in a certain class of interference networks. For a class of\nX-channels, the results show how to optimally use distributed and\nmoderately-delayed CSIT to yield the same sum-DoF as instantaneous and global\nCSIT.

When all channels\nare assumed to be i.i.d. fading, a static schedule where the relay listens half\nthe time and transmits half the time combined with quantize-map-forward (QMF)\nrelaying is known to achieve the full-duplex performance.

The\nadvantages of our proposed DCE scheme are two folds: 1) compared to the\nexisting DCE scheme based on the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE)\nchannel estimator, the proposed scheme adopts a semiblind approach and achieves\nbetter DCE performance; 2) the proposed scheme is robust against active\neavesdropping with the pilot contamination attack, whereas the existing scheme\nfails under such an attack.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 May 2014 07:31:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Junjie", ""], ["Xie", "Shengli", ""], ["Zhou", "Xiangyun", ""], ["Yu", "Rong", ""], ["Zhang", "Yan", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.4628", "submitter": "Sinan G\\\"unt\\\"urk", "authors": "Evan Chou, Sinan G\\\"unt\\\"urk", "title": "Distributed noise-shaping quantization: I.

A famous trend to overcome this issue is to focus\non subclasses of alternant/Goppa codes with a non trivial automorphism group.\nSuch codes display then symmetries allowing compact parity-check or generator\nmatrices. For instance, a key-reduction is obtained by taking quasi-cyclic (QC)\nor quasi-dyadic (QD) alternant/Goppa codes.

It is indeed possible to reduce the key-recovery on the original\nsymmetric public-code to the key-recovery on a (much) smaller code that has not\nanymore symmetries.

This\noperation consists in adding the coordinates of codewords which belong to the\nsame orbit under the action of the automorphism group. The advantage is\ntwofold: the reduction factor can be as large as the size of the orbits, and it\npreserves a fundamental property: folding the dual of an alternant (resp.\nGoppa) code provides the dual of an alternant (resp.

We establish the properties of optimal solutions, and\nleverage the theoretical analysis to develop a fast algorithm to obtain an\n\\emph{exact} solution to the problem. The suggested solution provides the\ntightest estimation of the $L_2$-norm or the correlation. We show that typical\ndata-analysis operations, such as k-NN search or k-Means clustering, can\noperate more accurately using the proposed compression and distance\nreconstruction technique. We compare it with many other prevalent compression\nand reconstruction techniques, including random projections and PCA-based\ntechniques. We highlight a surprising result, namely that when the data are\nhighly sparse in some basis, our technique may even outperform PCA-based\ncompression.\n  The contributions of this work are generic as our methodology is applicable\nto any sequential or high-dimensional data as well as to any orthogonal data\ntransformation used for the underlying data compression scheme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 May 2014 15:01:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-26", "authors_parsed": [["Vlachos", "Michail", ""], ["Freris", "Nikolaos", ""], ["Kyrillidis", "Anastasios", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.5887", "submitter": "Jinchun Zhan Jinchun Zhan", "authors": "Jinchun Zhan, Namrata Vaswani, Chenlu Qiu", "title": "Performance Guarantees for ReProCS -- Correlated Low-Rank Matrix Entries\n  Case", "comments": "long version of conference paper", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Online or recursive robust PCA can be posed as a problem of recovering a\nsparse vector, $S_t$, and a dense vector, $L_t$, which lies in a slowly\nchanging low-dimensional subspace, from $M_t:= S_t + L_t$ on-the-fly as new\ndata comes in. For initialization, it is assumed that an accurate knowledge of\nthe subspace in which $L_0$ lies is available. In recent works, Qiu et al\nproposed and analyzed a novel solution to this problem called recursive\nprojected compressed sensing or ReProCS. In this work, we relax one limiting\nassumption of Qiu et al's result. Their work required that the $L_t$'s be\nmutually independent over time. However this is not a practical assumption,\ne.g., in the video application, $L_t$ is the background image sequence and one\nwould expect it to be correlated over time. In this work we relax this and\nallow the $L_t$'s to follow an autoregressive model. We are able to show that\nunder mild assumptions and under a denseness assumption on the unestimated part\nof the changed subspace, with high probability (w.h.p.), ReProCS can exactly\nrecover the support set of $S_t$ at all times; the reconstruction errors of\nboth $S_t$ and $L_t$ are upper bounded by a time invariant and small value; and\nthe subspace recovery error decays to a small value within a finite delay of a\nsubspace change time.

Roughly, the idea of CPC\nconsists in embedding information (about a random state) into the transmit\npower levels themselves: in this new framework, provided the power levels of a\ngiven transmitter can be observed (through a noisy channels) by other\ntransmitters, a sequence of power levels of the former can therefore be used to\ncoordinate the latter. To assess the limiting performance of CPC (and therefore\nthe potential performance brought by this new approach), we derive, as a first\nstep towards many extensions of the present work, a general result which not\nonly concerns power control (PC) but also any scenario involving two\ndecision-makers (DMs) which communicate through their actions and have the\nfollowing information and decision structures. We assume that the DMs want to\nmaximize the average of an arbitrarily chosen instantaneous payoff function\nwhich depends on the DMs' actions and the state realization. DM 1 is assumed to\nknow non-causally the state (e.g., the channel state) which affects the common\npayoff while the other, say DM 2, has only a strictly causal knowledge of it.\nDM 1 can only use its own actions (e.g., power levels) to inform DM 2 about its\nbest action in terms of payoff. Importantly, DM 2 can only monitor the actions\nof DM 1 imperfectly and DM 1 does not observe DM 2. The latter assumption leads\nus to exploiting Shannon-theoretic tools in order to generalize an existing\ntheorem which provides the information constraint under which the payoff is\nmaximized. The derived result is then exploited to fully characterize the\nperformance of good CPC policies for a given instance of the interference\nchannel.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 May 2014 13:47:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Larrousse", "Benjamin", ""], ["Lasaulce", "Samson", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.6948", "submitter": "Laszlo Gyongyosi Dr.", "authors": "Laszlo Gyongyosi", "title": "Multidimensional Manifold Extraction for Multicarrier\n  Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution", "comments": "39 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce the multidimensional manifold extraction for multicarrier\ncontinuous-variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD).

It is shown\nthat while the AONT-RS scheme requires the adoption of fragmentation for\nachieving widespread distribution, thus penalizing the performance, the new\nAONT-LT scheme can exploit variable length codes which allow to achieve very\ngood performance and scalability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 May 2014 15:22:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Baldi", "Marco", ""], ["Maturo", "Nicola", ""], ["Montali", "Eugenio", ""], ["Chiaraluce", "Franco", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.7601", "submitter": "Nicola Cufaro Petroni", "authors": "Nicola Cufaro Petroni", "title": "Entropy and its discontents: A note on definitions", "comments": "18 pages, 7 figures; minor modifications required by referees; 1\n  reference and Acknowledgements added", "journal-ref": "Entropy (2014), 16, 4044-4059", "doi": "10.3390/e16074044", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT physics.comp-ph physics.data-an", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The routine definitions of both entropy, and differential entropy show\ninconsistencies that make them not reciprocally coherent.

In this paper, we propose the first full-duplex system utilizing\nMulti-Reconfigurable Antenna (MRA) with ?90% rate improvement compared to\nhalf-duplex systems. MRA is a dynamically reconfigurable antenna structure,\nthat is capable of changing its properties according to certain input\nconfigurations. A comprehensive experimental analysis is conducted to\ncharacterize the system performance in typical indoor environments. The\nexperiments are performed using a fabricated MRA that has 4096 configurable\nradiation patterns. The achieved MRA-based passive self-interference\nsuppression is investigated, with detailed analysis for the MRA training\noverhead. In addition, a heuristic-based approach is proposed to reduce the MRA\ntraining overhead. The results show that at 1% training overhead, a total of\n95dB self-interference cancellation is achieved in typical indoor environments.\nThe 95dB self-interference cancellation is experimentally shown to be\nsufficient for 90% full-duplex rate improvement compared to half-duplex\nsystems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 May 2014 20:40:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ahmed", "Elsayed", ""], ["Eltawil", "Ahmed M.", ""], ["Li", "Zhouyuan", ""], ["Cetiner", "Bedri A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.7812", "submitter": "Ziv Goldfeld", "authors": "Ziv Goldfeld, Haim H.

The denoising method is a fully data driven approach.

The basic principle of the method is to decompose a speech signal into\nsegments each frame is categorised as either signal-dominant or noise-dominant\nthen reconstruct the signal with IMFs signal dominant frame previously filtered\nor thresholded. It is shown, on the basis of intensive simulations that EMD\nimproves the signal to noise ratio and address the problem of signal\ndegradation. The denoising method is applied to real signal with different\nnoise levels and the results compared to Winner and universal threshold of\nDONOHO and JOHNSTONE [11] with soft and hard tresholding.
