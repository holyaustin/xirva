In this paper, we study\npossible dictionaries for representing the discrete vector one obtains when\ncollecting a finite set of uniform samples from a multiband analog signal. By\nanalyzing the spectrum of combined time- and multiband-limiting operations in\nthe discrete-time domain, we conclude that the information level of the sampled\nmultiband vectors is essentially equal to the time-frequency area. For\nrepresenting these vectors, we consider a dictionary formed by concatenating a\ncollection of modulated Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequences (DPSS's). We\nstudy the angle between the subspaces spanned by this dictionary and an optimal\ndictionary, and we conclude that the multiband modulated DPSS dictionary--which\nis simple to construct and more flexible than the optimal dictionary in\npractical applications--is nearly optimal for representing multiband sample\nvectors.

The first part is an introduction to classical and\nquantum information theory (CIT, QIT): basic definitions and tools of CIT are\nintroduced, such as the information content of a random variable, the typical\nset, and some principles of data compression. Some concepts and results of QIT\nare then introduced, such as the qubit, the pure and mixed states, the Holevo\ntheorem, the no-cloning theorem, and the quantum complementarity. In the second\npart, two applications of QIT to open problems in theoretical physics are\ndiscussed. The black hole (BH) information paradox is related to the phenomenon\nof the Hawking radiation (HR). Consid- ering a BH starting in a pure state,\nafter its complete evaporation only the Hawking radiation will remain, which is\nshown to be in a mixed state. This either describes a non-unitary evolution of\nan isolated system, contradicting the evolution postulate of quantum mechanics\nand violating the no-cloning theorem, or it implies that the initial\ninformation content can escape the BH, therefore contradicting general\nrelativity. The progress toward the solution of the paradox is discussed. The\nrenormalization group (RG) aims at the extraction of the macroscopic\ndescription of a physical system from its microscopic description. This passage\nfrom microscopic to macroscopic can be described in terms of several steps from\none scale to another, and is therefore formalized as the action of a group. The\nc-theorem proves the existence, under certain conditions, of a function which\nis monotonically decreasing along the group transformations.

We employed an\nadaptive Wiener filter as the image denoiser, and called our algorithm\n\"AMP-Wiener.\" In this paper, we extend AMP-Wiener to three-dimensional\nhyperspectral image reconstruction, and call it \"AMP-3D-Wiener.\" Applying the\nAMP framework to the CASSI system is challenging, because the matrix that\nmodels the CASSI system is highly sparse, and such a matrix is not suitable to\nAMP and makes it difficult for AMP to converge. Therefore, we modify the\nadaptive Wiener filter and employ a technique called damping to solve for the\ndivergence issue of AMP. Our approach is applied in nature, and the numerical\nexperiments show that AMP-3D-Wiener outperforms existing widely-used algorithms\nsuch as gradient projection for sparse reconstruction (GPSR) and two-step\niterative shrinkage/thresholding (TwIST) given a similar amount of runtime.\nMoreover, in contrast to GPSR and TwIST, AMP-3D-Wiener need not tune any\nparameters, which simplifies the reconstruction process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 5 Jul 2015 17:43:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 13 Sep 2015 03:09:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 28 Oct 2015 15:42:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["Tan", "Jin", ""], ["Ma", "Yanting", ""], ["Rueda", "Hoover", ""], ["Baron", "Dror", ""], ["Arce", "Gonzalo", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.01255", "submitter": "Neri Merhav", "authors": "Neri Merhav", "title": "Universal Decoding for Source-Channel Coding with Side Information", "comments": "31 pages; 2 figures.

Without assumptions on\nthe signal and the filter, BD does not admit a unique solution. In practice,\nsubspace or sparsity assumptions have shown the ability to reduce the search\nspace and yield the unique solution. However, existing theoretical analysis on\nuniqueness in BD is rather limited. In an earlier paper, we provided the first\nalgebraic sample complexities for BD that hold for almost all bases or frames.\nWe showed that for BD of a pair of vectors in $\\mathbb{C}^n$, with subspace\nconstraints of dimensions $m_1$ and $m_2$, respectively, a sample complexity of\n$n\\geq m_1m_2$ is sufficient. This result is suboptimal, since the number of\ndegrees of freedom is merely $m_1+m_2-1$. We provided analogus results, with\nsimilar suboptimality, for BD with sparsity or mixed subspace and sparsity\nconstraints. In this paper, taking advantage of the recent progress on the\ninformation-theoretic limits of unique low-rank matrix recovery, we finally\nbridge this gap, and derive an optimal sample complexity result for BD with\ngeneric bases or frames. We show that for BD of an arbitrary pair (resp. all\npairs) of vectors in $\\mathbb{C}^n$, with sparsity constraints of sparsity\nlevels $s_1$ and $s_2$, a sample complexity of $n > s_1+s_2$ (resp. $n >\n2(s_1+s_2)$) is sufficient.

Simulation results show the performance gains (up to 5\ndB improvement) of the optimal non-coherent data detection with a low\ncomputational complexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Jul 2015 21:40:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 10 Jul 2015 22:07:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Alshamary", "Haider Ali Jasim", ""], ["Anjum", "Md Fahim", ""], ["Al-Naffouri", "Tareq", ""], ["Zaib", "Alam", ""], ["Xu", "Weiyu", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.02342", "submitter": "Ibrahim Issa", "authors": "Ibrahim Issa and Aaron B.

The receiver\nincorporates sparsity-based parametric channel estimation. State-of-the-art\nsparsity-based iterative receivers simplify the channel estimation problem by\nrestricting the multipath delays to a grid. Our receiver does not impose such a\nrestriction. As a result it does not suffer from the leakage effect, which\ndestroys sparsity. Communication at near capacity rates in high SNR requires a\nlarge modulation order. Due to the close proximity of modulation symbols in\nsuch systems, the grid-based approximation is of insufficient accuracy. We show\nnumerically that a state-of-the-art iterative receiver with grid-based sparse\nchannel estimation exhibits a bit-error-rate floor in the high SNR regime. On\nthe contrary, our receiver performs very close to the perfect channel state\ninformation bound for all SNR values.

First, the secondary relays sense the wireless\nchannel, scanning for a primary network activity, and then convey their reports\nto a secondary base station (SBS).

This is in\ncontrast to legacy wireless systems where data is embedded in a Radio Frequency\n(RF) source prior to the transmit antenna. MBM offers several advantages vs.\nlegacy systems, including \"additivity of information over multiple receive\nantennas\", and \"inherent diversity over a static fading channel\". MBM is\nparticularly suitable for transmitting high data rates using a single transmit\nand multiple receive antennas (Single Input-Multiple Output Media-Based\nModulation, or SIMO-MBM). However, complexity issues limit the amount of data\nthat can be embedded in the channel state using a single transmit unit. To\naddress this shortcoming, the current article introduces the idea of Layered\nMultiple Input-Multiple Output Media-Based Modulation (LMIMO-MBM). Relying on a\nlayered structure, LMIMO-MBM can significantly reduce both hardware and\nalgorithmic complexities, as well as the training overhead, vs. SIMO-MBM.\nSimulation results show excellent performance in terms of Symbol Error Rate\n(SER) vs. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). For example, a $4\\times 16$ LMIMO-MBM is\ncapable of transmitting $32$ bits of information per (complex) channel-use,\nwith SER $ \\simeq 10^{-5}$ at $E_b/N_0\\simeq -3.5$dB (or SER $ \\simeq 10^{-4}$\nat $E_b/N_0=-4.5$dB). This performance is achieved using a single transmission\nand without adding any redundancy for Forward-Error-Correction (FEC). This\nmeans, in addition to its excellent SER vs. energy/rate performance, MBM\nrelaxes the need for complex FEC structures, and thereby minimizes the\ntransmission delay. Overall, LMIMO-MBM provides a promising alternative to MIMO\nand Massive MIMO for the realization of 5G wireless networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Jul 2015 18:30:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 Sep 2015 18:34:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 7 Oct 2015 15:08:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-08", "authors_parsed": [["Seifi", "Ehsan", ""], ["Atamanesh", "Mehran", ""], ["Khandani", "Amir K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.07628", "submitter": "Xishuo Liu", "authors": "Xishuo Liu, Stark C.

In the neuronal hierarchy, the response\nproperties of single neurons are determined by neurons located one level below,\nand in turn, determine the responses of neurons located one level above.\nTherefore in modeling receptive fields, it is essential to ensure that the\nresponse properties of neurons in a given level can be generated by combining\nthe response models of neurons in its input levels. However, existing response\nmodels of neurons in the motion cortex do not inherently yield the temporal\nfrequency filtering gradient (TFFG) property that is known to emerge along the\nprimary visual cortex (V1) to middle temporal (MT) motion processing stream.\nTFFG is the change from predominantly lowpass to predominantly bandpass\ntemporal frequency filtering character along the V1 to MT pathway (Foster et al\n1985; DeAngelis et al 1993; Hawken et al 1996). We devised a new model, the\nsinc wavelet model (Odaibo, 2014), which logically and efficiently generates\nthe TFFG. The model replaces the Gabor function's sine wave carrier with a sinc\n(sin(x)/x) function, and has the same or fewer number of parameters as existing\nmodels. Because of its logical consistency with the emergent network property\nof TFFG, we conclude that the sinc wavelet is a better model for the receptive\nfields of motion cortex neurons.
