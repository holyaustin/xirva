Although it is notoriously difficult to derive\ngeneral end-to-end capacity results for multi-terminal or \\adhoc networks, the\ntransmission capacity (TC) framework allows for quantification of achievable\nsingle-hop rates by focusing on a simplified physical/MAC-layer model. By using\nstochastic geometry to quantify the multi-user interference in the network, the\nrelationship between the optimal spatial density and success probability of\ntransmissions in the network can be determined, and expressed -- often fairly\nsimply -- in terms of the key network parameters. The basic model and\nanalytical tools are first discussed and applied to a simple network with path\nloss only and we present tight upper and lower bounds on transmission capacity\n(via lower and upper bounds on outage probability).

Under certain scaling of the statistics of the bit-arrival\nprocess with SNR, this paper shows that the optimal decay behavior of the\nasymptotic total probability of bit error depends on how fast the burstiness of\nthe source scales down with SNR. If the source burstiness scales down too\nslowly, the total probability of error is asymptotically dominated by\ndelay-violation events. On the other hand, if the source burstiness scales down\ntoo quickly, the total probability of error is asymptotically dominated by\nchannel-error events. However, at the proper scaling, where the burstiness\nscales linearly with 1/sqrt(log SNR) and at the optimal coding duration and\ntransmission rate, the occurrences of channel errors and delay-violation errors\nare asymptotically balanced. In this latter case, the optimal exponent of the\ntotal probability of error reveals a tradeoff that addresses the question of\nhow much of the allowable time and rate should be used for gaining reliability\nover the channel and how much for accommodating the burstiness with delay\nconstraints.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Sep 2008 15:37:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Kittipiyakul", "Somsak", ""], ["Elia", "Petros", ""], ["Javidi", "Tara", ""]]}, {"id": "0809.1043", "submitter": "Marco Dalai", "authors": "Marco Dalai, Riccardo Leonardi", "title": "On Unique Decodability", "comments": "Accepted for publication, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TIT.2008.929941", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we propose a revisitation of the topic of unique decodability\nand of some fundamental theorems of lossless coding.

Code diversity\nis an alternative and complementary approach where a small number of feedback\nbits are used to select from a family of space-time codes.

The enabling technique\nfor this success is the use of random access schemes for the wireless channel.\nRandom access requires minimal coordination between the nodes, which\nconsiderably reduces the cost of the infrastructure. Recently, cooperative\ncommunication in wireless networks has been of increasing interest because it\npromises higher rates and reliability. An additional MAC overhead is necessary\nto coordinate the nodes to allow cooperation and this overhead can possibly\ncancel out the cooperative benefits. In this work, a completely distributed\nprotocol is proposed that allows nodes in the network to cooperate via Two-Hop\nand Decode-and-Forward for transmitting their data to a common gateway node. It\nis shown that high throughput gains are obtained in terms of the individual\nthroughput that can be guaranteed to any node in the network. These results are\nvalidated by Monte Carlo simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Sep 2008 14:17:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Nov 2009 15:57:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["B\u00f6cherer", "Georg", ""], ["de Baynast", "Alexandre", ""]]}, {"id": "0809.5212", "submitter": "Hyoungsuk  Jeon", "authors": "Hyoungsuk Jeon, Namshik Kim, Minki Kim, Hyuckjae Lee, and Jeongseok Ha", "title": "Secrecy Capacity over Correlated Ergodic Fading Channel", "comments": "18 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IEEE Transaction on Information\n  Theory", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We investigate the secrecy capacity of an ergodic fading wiretap channel in\nwhich the main channel is correlated with the eavesdropper channel. In this\nstudy, the full Channel State Information (CSI) is assumed, and thus the\ntransmitter knows the channel gains of the legitimate receiver and the\neavesdropper. By analyzing the resulting secrecy capacity we quantify the loss\nof the secrecy capacity due to the correlation. In addition, we study the\nasymptotic behavior of the secrecy capacity as Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)\ntends to infinity. The capacity of an ordinary fading channel logarithmically\nincreases with SNR. On the contrary, the secrecy capacity converges into a\nlimit which can be an upper bound on the secrecy capacity over the fading\nwiretap channel. We find a closed form of the upper bound for the correlated\nRayleigh wiretap channel which also includes the independent case as a special\none. Our work shows that the upper bound is determined by only two channel\nparameters; the correlation coefficient and the ratio of the main to the\neavesdropper channel gains that will be called PCC and CGR respectively. The\nanalysis of the upper bound tells how the two channel parameters affect the\nsecrecy capacity and leads to the conclusion that the excessively large signal\npower does not provide any advantage in the secrecy capacity, and the loss due\nto the correlation is especially serious in low CGR regime.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Sep 2008 14:43:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Jeon", "Hyoungsuk", ""], ["Kim", "Namshik", ""], ["Kim", "Minki", ""], ["Lee", "Hyuckjae", ""], ["Ha", "Jeongseok", ""]]}, {"id": "0809.5217", "submitter": "Emmanuel Abbe A", "authors": "Emmanuel Abbe and Lizhong Zheng", "title": "Linear Universal Decoding for Compound Channels: a Local to Global\n  Geometric Approach", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Over discrete memoryless channels (DMC), linear decoders (maximizing additive\nmetrics) afford several nice properties. In particular, if suitable encoders\nare employed, the use of decoding algorithm with manageable complexities is\npermitted. Maximum likelihood is an example of linear decoder. For a compound\nDMC, decoders that perform well without the channel's knowledge are required in\norder to achieve capacity. Several such decoders have been studied in the\nliterature.

Hence, the\nproblem of finding linear decoders achieving capacity for compound DMC is\naddressed, and it is shown that under minor concessions, such decoders exist\nand can be constructed.
