The proposed key sharing\nprotocol does not assume any prior knowledge about the channel state\ninformation (CSI), but, harnesses the available opportunistic secrecy gains\nusing only the one bit feedback, in the form of ACK/NACK. The distribution of\nkey bits among multiple ARQ epochs, in our approach, allows for mitigating the\nsecrecy outage phenomenon observed in earlier works. We characterize the\ninformation theoretic limits of the proposed scheme, under different\nassumptions on the channel spatial and temporal correlation function, and\ndevelop low complexity explicit implementations. Our analysis reveals a novel\nrole of \"dumb antennas\" in overcoming the negative impact of spatial\ncorrelation, between the legitimate and eavesdropper channels, on the\nachievable secrecy rates. We further develop an adaptive rate allocation policy\nwhich achieves higher secrecy rates by exploiting the channel temporal\ncorrelation.

The protocol was presented in a theoretical framework and\nconsidered only in conjunction with TCP Vegas. In this paper we present a\nreal-world implementation of this protocol that addresses several important\npractical aspects of incorporating network coding and decoding with TCP's\nwindow management mechanism. Further, we work with the more widespread and\npractical TCP Reno.

In this paper, we study the two-user Gaussian\ninterference channel with conferencing decoders to answer this question in a\nsimple setting. We characterize the fundamental gain from cooperation: at high\nSNR, when INR is below 50% of SNR in dB scale, one-bit cooperation per\ndirection buys roughly one-bit gain per user until full receiver cooperation\nperformance is reached, while when INR is between 67% and 200% of SNR in dB\nscale, one-bit cooperation per direction buys roughly half-bit gain per user.\nThe conclusion is drawn based on the approximate characterization of the\nsymmetric capacity in the symmetric set-up.

The new technique\nenjoys the advantages of MIMO radar without sacrificing the main advantage of\nphased-array radar which is the coherent processing gain at the transmitting\nside. The essence of the proposed technique is to partition the transmitting\narray into a number of subarrays that are allowed to overlap. Then, each\nsubarray is used to coherently transmit a waveform which is orthogonal to the\nwaveforms transmitted by other subarrays. Coherent processing gain can be\nachieved by designing a weight vector for each subarray to form a beam towards\na certain direction in space.

Assume a wireless sensor network with $n$\nnodes that have limited power, memory, and bandwidth. Each node is capable of\nboth sensing and storing data. Such sensor nodes might disappear from the\nnetwork due to failures or battery depletion. Hence it is desired to design\nefficient schemes to collect data from these $n$ nodes. We propose two\ndistributed storage algorithms (DSA's) that utilize network flooding to solve\nthis problem. In the first algorithm, DSA-I, we assume that every node utilizes\nnetwork flooding to disseminate its data throughout the network using a mixing\ntime of approximately O(n). We show that this algorithm is efficient in terms\nof the encoding and decoding operations. In the second algorithm, DSA-II, we\nassume that the total number of nodes is not known to every sensor; hence\ndissemination of the data does not depend on $n$. The encoding operations in\nthis case take $O(C\\mu^2)$, where $\\mu$ is the mean degree of the network graph\nand $C$ is a system parameter. We evaluate the performance of the proposed\nalgorithms through analysis and simulation, and show that their performance\nmatches the derived theoretical results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Aug 2009 20:16:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Aly", "Salah A.", ""], ["Darwish", "Hager S.", ""], ["Youssef", "Moustafa", ""], ["Zidan", "Mahmoud", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.4445", "submitter": "Liang-Liang Xie", "authors": "Xiugang Wu and Liang-Liang Xie", "title": "Asymptotic Equipartition Property of Output when Rate is above Capacity", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The output distribution, when rate is above capacity, is investigated.

This question was posed in \\cite{rat0903} who\nshowed that the more complex the learner the higher the possibility that his\nmistakes deviate from a true random sequence. In the current paper we report on\nan empirical investigation of this problem. We investigate two characteristics\nof randomness, the stochastic and algorithmic complexity of the binary sequence\nof mistakes. A learner with a Markov model of order $k$ is trained on a finite\nbinary sequence produced by a Markov source of order $k^{*}$ and is tested on a\ndifferent random sequence. As a measure of learner's complexity we define a\nquantity called the \\emph{sysRatio}, denoted by $\\rho$, which is the ratio\nbetween the compressed and uncompressed lengths of the binary string whose\n$i^{th}$ bit represents the maximum \\emph{a posteriori} decision made at state\n$i$ of the learner's model. The quantity $\\rho$ is a measure of information\ndensity. The main result of the paper shows that this ratio is crucial in\nanswering the above posed question. The result indicates that there is a\ncritical threshold $\\rho^{*}$ such that when $\\rho\\leq\\rho^{*}$ the sequence of\nmistakes possesses the following features: (1)\\emph{}low divergence $\\Delta$\nfrom a random sequence, (2) low variance in algorithmic complexity. When\n$\\rho>\\rho^{*}$, the characteristics of the mistake sequence changes sharply\ntowards a\\emph{}high\\emph{$\\Delta$} and high variance in algorithmic\ncomplexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Aug 2009 10:05:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Ratsaby", "Joel", ""]]}]
