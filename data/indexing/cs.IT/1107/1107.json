The UAV uses\nbeamforming to mitigate the inter-user interference and achieve spatial\ndivision multiple access (SDMA). First, we consider a simple scenario with two\nstatic ground nodes and analytically investigate the effect of the UAV heading\non the system sum rate. We then study a more general setting with multiple\nmobile ground-based terminals, and develop an algorithm for dynamically\nadjusting the UAV heading in order to maximize a lower bound on the ergodic sum\nrate of the uplink channel, using a Kalman filter to track the positions of the\nmobile ground nodes. Fairness among the users can be guaranteed through\nweighting the bound for each user's ergodic rate with a factor inversely\nproportional to their average data rate. For the common scenario where a high\n$K$-factor channel exists between the ground nodes and UAV, we use an\nasymptotic analysis to find simplified versions of the algorithm for low and\nhigh SNR. We present simulation results that demonstrate the benefits of\nadapting the UAV heading in order to optimize the uplink communications\nperformance. The simulation results also show that the simplified algorithms\nperform near-optimal performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jun 2011 22:28:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 8 Jul 2011 05:12:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 4 Apr 2012 22:35:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Jiang", "Feng", ""], ["Swindlehurst", "A.

Finally, we determine an achievable rate region for\ncommunication over an entanglement-assisted bosonic multiple access channel and\ncompare it with the Yen-Shapiro outer bound for unassisted communication over\nthe same channel.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Jul 2011 11:30:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 11 Jul 2011 19:07:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 16 Aug 2011 07:43:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-27", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Shen Chen", ""], ["Wilde", "Mark M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.1409", "submitter": "Romain Couillet", "authors": "Romain Couillet and Walid Hachem", "title": "Fluctuations of spiked random matrix models and failure diagnosis in\n  sensor networks", "comments": "To appear in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 2012", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this article, the joint fluctuations of the extreme eigenvalues and\neigenvectors of a large dimensional sample covariance matrix are analyzed when\nthe associated population covariance matrix is a finite-rank perturbation of\nthe identity matrix, corresponding to the so-called spiked model in random\nmatrix theory.

More\nspecifically, the measure of the support of the fading-process power spectral\ndensity (PSD) determines if noncoherent capacity grows logarithmically in SNR\nor slower than logarithmically. Such a result is unsatisfactory from an\nengineering point of view, as the support of the PSD cannot be determined\nthrough measurements. The aim of this paper is to assess whether, for general\ncontinuous-time Rayleigh-fading channels, this sensitivity has a noticeable\nimpact on capacity at SNR values of practical interest.\n  To this end, we consider the general class of band-limited continuous-time\nRayleigh-fading channels that satisfy the wide-sense stationary\nuncorrelated-scattering (WSSUS) assumption and are, in addition, underspread.\nWe show that, for all SNR values of practical interest, the noncoherent\ncapacity of every channel in this class is close to the capacity of an AWGN\nchannel with the same SNR and bandwidth, independently of the measure of the\nsupport of the scattering function (the two-dimensional channel PSD).

This paper presents an analysis\nof both attenuated max-product (AMP) decoding and weighted min-sum (WMS)\ndecoding for LDPC codes which guarantees convergence to a fixed point when a\nweight parameter, {\\beta}, is sufficiently small. It also shows that, if the\nfixed point satisfies some consistency conditions, then it must be both the\nlinear-programming (LP) and maximum-likelihood (ML) solution.\n  For (dv,dc)-regular LDPC codes, the weight must satisfy {\\beta}(dv-1) \\leq 1\nwhereas the results proposed by Frey and Koetter require instead that\n{\\beta}(dv-1)(dc-1) < 1. A counterexample which shows a fixed point might not\nbe the ML solution if {\\beta}(dv-1) > 1 is also given. Finally, connections are\nexplored with recent work by Arora et al. on the threshold of LP decoding.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Jul 2011 22:58:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Jian", "Yung-Yih", ""], ["Pfister", "Henry D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.3199", "submitter": "Bo Li", "authors": "Bo Li, Cem Boyaci, Ye Xia", "title": "Performance Guarantee under Longest-Queue-First Schedule in Wireless\n  Networks", "comments": "27 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Efficient link scheduling in a wireless network is challenging. Typical\noptimal algorithms require solving an NP-hard sub-problem. To meet the\nchallenge, one stream of research focuses on finding simpler sub-optimal\nalgorithms that have low complexity but high efficiency in practice. In this\npaper, we study the performance guarantee of one such scheduling algorithm, the\nLongest-Queue-First (LQF) algorithm. It is known that the LQF algorithm\nachieves the full capacity region, $\\Lambda$, when the interference graph\nsatisfies the so-called local pooling condition. For a general graph $G$, LQF\nachieves (i.e., stabilizes) a part of the capacity region, $\\sigma^*(G)\n\\Lambda$, where $\\sigma^*(G)$ is the overall local pooling factor of the\ninterference graph $G$ and $\\sigma^*(G) \\leq 1$. It has been shown later that\nLQF achieves a larger rate region, $\\Sigma^*(G) \\Lambda$, where $\\Sigma^ (G)$\nis a diagonal matrix. The contribution of this paper is to describe three new\nachievable rate regions, which are larger than the previously-known regions. In\nparticular, the new regions include all the extreme points of the capacity\nregion and are not convex in general. We also discover a counter-intuitive\nphenomenon in which increasing the arrival rate may sometime help to stabilize\nthe network.

The proposed\nsolution employs lattice reduction (LR)-aided regularized (lattice) sphere\ndecoding and proper timeout policies. These performance and complexity\nguarantees hold for most MIMO scenarios, all reasonable fading statistics, all\nchannel dimensions and all full-rate lattice codes.\n  In sharp contrast to the above manageable complexity, the complexity of other\nstandard preprocessed lattice decoding solutions is shown here to be extremely\nhigh. Specifically the work is first to quantify the complexity of these\nlattice (sphere) decoding solutions and to prove the surprising result that the\ncomplexity required to achieve a certain rate-reliability performance, is\nexponential in the lattice dimensionality and in the number of codeword bits,\nand it in fact matches, in common scenarios, the complexity of ML-based\nsolutions. Through this sharp contrast, the work was able to, for the first\ntime, rigorously quantify the pivotal role of lattice reduction as a special\ncomplexity reducing ingredient.\n  Finally the work analytically refines transceiver DMT analysis which\ngenerally fails to address potentially massive gaps between theory and\npractice. Instead the adopted vanishing gap condition guarantees that the\ndecoder's error curve is arbitrarily close, given a sufficiently high SNR, to\nthe optimal error curve of exact solutions, which is a much stronger condition\nthan DMT optimality which only guarantees an error gap that is subpolynomial in\nSNR, and can thus be unbounded and generally unacceptable in practical\nsettings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Jul 2011 16:14:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Singh", "Arun", ""], ["Elia", "Petros", ""], ["Jalden", "Joakim", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.4057", "submitter": "Nick Mehrdad Loghmani", "authors": "Nick Mehrdad Loghmani", "title": "The Harmonic Theory; A mathematical framework to build intelligent\n  contextual and adaptive computing, cognition and sensory system", "comments": "16 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Harmonic theory provides a mathematical framework to describe the structure,\nbehavior, evolution and emergence of harmonic systems.

A general transmission scheme for any\nmemoryless, single-hop, k-user channel with or without common information, is\ndefined through two steps. The first step is user virtualization: each user is\ndivided into multiple virtual sub-users according to a chosen rate-splitting\nstrategy which preserves the rates of the original messages. This results in an\nenhanced channel with a possibly larger number of users for which more coding\npossibilities are available. Moreover, user virtualization provides a simple\nmechanism to encode common messages to any subset of users. Following user\nvirtualization, the message of each user in the enhanced model is coded using a\nchosen combination of coded time-sharing, superposition coding and joint\nbinning. A graph is used to represent the chosen coding strategies: nodes in\nthe graph represent codewords while edges represent coding operations. This\ngraph is used to construct a graphical Markov model which illustrates the\nstatistical dependency among codewords that can be introduced by the\nsuperposition coding or joint binning. Using this statistical representation of\nthe overall codebook distribution, the error probability of the code is shown\nto vanish via a unified analysis. The rate bounds that define the achievable\nrate region are obtained by linking the error analysis to the properties of the\ngraphical Markov model. This proposed framework makes it possible to\nnumerically obtain an achievable rate region by specifying a user\nvirtualization strategy and describing a set of coding operations.
