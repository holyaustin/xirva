As a consequence, TINnoTS is optimal from a\ngeneralized Degrees of Freedom (gDoF) perspective for all channel gains except\nfor a subset of zero measure. TINnoTS with Gaussian inputs is known to be\noptimal to within 1/2 bit for a subset of the weak interference regime.\nSurprisingly, this paper shows that TINnoTS is gDoG optimal in all parameter\nregimes, even in the strong and very strong interference regimes where joint\ndecoding of Gaussian inputs is optimal. For approximate optimality of TINnoTS\nin all parameter regimes it is critical to use non-Gaussian inputs. This work\nthus proposes to use mixed inputs as channel inputs where a mixed input is the\nsum of a discrete and a Gaussian random variable. Interestingly, compared to\nthe Han-Kobayashi inner bound, the discrete part of a mixed input is shown to\neffectively act as a common message in the sense that, although treated as\nnoise, its effect on the achievable rate region is as if it were jointly\ndecoded together with the desired messages at a non-intended receiver.

The above two new properties is also discussed in\nthis paper when $F$ is not far away from a linear measurement operator $T$\nhaving the restricted isometry property.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Jun 2015 05:56:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Sun", "Qiyu", ""], ["Tang", "Wai-Shing", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.03656", "submitter": "Salah Eddine Hajri", "authors": "Salah Eddine Hajri and Mohamad Assaad", "title": "An Exclusion zone for Massive MIMO With Underlay D2D Communication", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Fifth generation networks will incorporate a variety of new features in\nwireless networks such as data offloading, D2D communication, and Massive MIMO.\nMassive MIMO is specially appealing since it achieves huge gains while enabling\nsimple processing like MRC receivers.

First, distance computations and slicing\noperations for an optimal 2-layer maximum a posteriori (MAP) MIMO detector are\noptimized to eliminate the use of multipliers and reduce the overhead of\nslicing in the presence of soft-input LLRs. We show that distances can be\neasily computed using elementary addition operations, while optimal slicing is\ndone via efficient comparisons with soft decision boundaries, resulting in a\nsimple feed-forward pipelined architecture.

In this model, the BS powered via a combination of a renewable power\nsource and the conventional electric grid, seeks to specify the renewable power\ninventory policy, i.e., the power storage level.

A set of simple linear\ncontracts are introduced to coordinate the system so as to achieve an optimal\nsystem performance.

In order to meet the ever increasing demand, it\nis inevitable that, future wireless networks will have to develop seamless\ninterconnection between multiple technologies. A manifestation of this idea is\nthe collaboration among different types of network tiers such as macro and\nsmall cells, leading to the so-called heterogeneous networks (HetNets).\nResearchers have used stochastic geometry to analyze such networks and\nunderstand their real potential. Unsurprisingly, it has been revealed that\ninterference has a detrimental effect on performance, especially if not modeled\nproperly. Interference can be correlated in space and/or time, which has been\noverlooked in the past. For instance, it is normally assumed that the nodes are\nlocated completely independent of each other and follow a homogeneous Poisson\npoint process (PPP), which is not necessarily true in real networks since the\nnode locations are spatially dependent. In addition, the interference\ncorrelation created by correlated stochastic processes has mostly been ignored.\nTo this end, we take a different approach in modeling the interference where we\nuse non-PPP, as well as we study the impact of spatial and temporal correlation\non the performance of HetNets. To illustrate the impact of correlation on\nperformance, we consider three case studies from real-life scenarios.\nSpecifically, we use massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) to\nunderstand the impact of spatial correlation; we use the random medium access\nprotocol to examine the temporal correlation; and we use cooperative relay\nnetworks to illustrate the spatial-temporal correlation.

Finally, as an application of our\ntechnical outcomes, we derive the upper bounds for a fundamental entropic\nquantity - the Holevo quantity - in quantum information science since\nclassical-quantum channels are a special instance of matrix-valued functions.\nThis is obtained through the equivalence between the constants in the strong\ndata processing inequality and the $\\Phi$-Sobolev inequality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Jun 2015 21:56:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 May 2019 18:05:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-06", "authors_parsed": [["Cheng", "Hao-Chung", ""], ["Hsieh", "Min-Hsiu", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.06822", "submitter": "Shahram Zarei", "authors": "Shahram Zarei, Wolfgang Gerstacker, Jocelyn Aulin, and Robert Schober", "title": "I/Q Imbalance Aware Widely-Linear Receiver for Uplink Multi-Cell Massive\n  MIMO Systems", "comments": "To appear in IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, 40 pages,\n  4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TWC.2016.2520935", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In-phase/quadrature-phase (I/Q) imbalance is one of the most important\nhardware impairments in communication systems.

A scalable signal processing\nframework is therefore highly desirable, which, as recently demonstrated in\n\\cite{Dai_TWireless}, could be established based on the concept of virtual\ncell.\n  In a virtual-cell based DAS, each user chooses a few closest base-station\n(BS) antennas to form its virtual cell, that is, its own serving BS antenna\nset. In this paper, we focus on a downlink DAS with a large number of users and\nBS antennas uniformly distributed in a certain area, and aim to study the\neffect of the virtual cell size on the average user rate. Specifically, by\nassuming that maximum ratio transmission (MRT) is adopted in each user's\nvirtual cell, the achievable ergodic rate of each user is derived as an\nexplicit function of the large-scale fading coefficients from all the users to\ntheir virtual cells, and an upper-bound of the average user rate is\nestablished, based on which a rule of thumb is developed for determining the\noptimal virtual cell size to maximize the average user rate. The analysis is\nfurther extended to consider multiple users grouped together and jointly served\nby their virtual cells using zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF). In contrast to\nthe no-grouping case where a small virtual cell size is preferred, it is shown\nthat by grouping users with overlapped virtual cells, the average user rate can\nbe significantly improved by increasing the virtual cell size, though at the\ncost of a higher signal processing complexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Jun 2015 16:58:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-21", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Junyuan", ""], ["Dai", "Lin", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.08879", "submitter": "Bruno Clerckx", "authors": "Bruno Clerckx, Ekaterina Bayguzina, David Yates, and Paul D.

In this paper, we study the stability and delay\nanalysis for two cooperative relaying schemes; the sensing-based cooperative\n(SBC) scheme and the decision-based cooperative (DBC) scheme. In the SBC\nscheme, the relay senses the channel at the beginning of each time slot. In the\nidle time slots, the relay transmits the packet at the head of its queue, while\nin the busy one, the relay decides either to transmit simultaneously with the\nsource terminal or to listen to the source transmission. The SBC scheme is a\nnovel paradigm that utilizes the spectrum more efficiently than the other\ncooperative schemes because the relay not only exploits the idle time slots,\nbut also has the capability to mildly interfere with the source terminal. On\nthe other hand, in the DBC scheme, the relay does not sense the channel and it\ndecides either to transmit or to listen according to certain probabilities.\nNumerical results reveal that the two proposed schemes outperform existing\ncooperative schemes that restrict the relay to send only in the idle time\nslots. Moreover, we show how the MPR capability at the destination can\ncompensate for the sensing need at the relay, i.e., the DBC scheme achieves\nalmost the same stability region as that of the SBC scheme.
