Under the assumption that frame\ncoefficients of images are sparse, several iterative thresholding algorithms\nfor the image inpainting problem have been proposed in the literature. The\noutputs of such iterative algorithms are closely linked to solutions of several\nconvex minimization models using the balanced approach which simultaneously\ncombines the $l_1$-regularization for sparsity of frame coefficients and the\n$l_2$-regularization for smoothness of the solution. Due to the redundancy of a\ntight frame, elements of a tight frame could be highly correlated and\ntherefore, their corresponding frame coefficients of an image are expected to\nclose to each other. This is called the grouping effect in statistics. In this\npaper, we establish the grouping effect property for frame-based convex\nminimization models using the balanced approach. This result on grouping effect\npartially explains the effectiveness of models using the balanced approach for\nseveral image restoration problems.

Here, the relays quantize their received\nsignals at the noise level and map them to random Gaussian codebooks. The\nresultant gap to capacity is independent of the SNRs of the channels in the\nnetwork and the topology but is linear in the total number of nodes.\n  In this paper, we provide an improved lower bound on the rate achieved by\ncompress-and-forward based strategies (noisy network coding in particular) in\narbitrary Gaussian relay networks, whose gap to capacity depends on the network\nnot only through the total number of nodes but also through the degrees of\nfreedom of the min cut of the network. We illustrate that for many networks,\nthis refined lower bound can lead to a better approximation of the capacity. In\nparticular, we demonstrate that it leads to a logarithmic rather than linear\ncapacity gap in the total number of nodes for certain classes of layered\nnetworks. The improvement comes from quantizing the received signals of the\nrelays at a resolution decreasing with the total number of nodes in the\nnetwork.

We initially describe three different cooperative channel sensing\nstrategies with different hard-decision combining algorithms at the ST, namely\nOR, Majority, and AND rules. Since the channel sensing occurs with possible\nerrors, we consider a combined interference power constraint by which the\ntransmission power of the secondary users (SUs) is bounded when the channel is\nsensed as both busy and idle. Furthermore, regarding the channel sensing\ndecision and its correctness, there exist possibly four different transmission\nscenarios. We provide the instantaneous ergodic capacities of the channel\nbetween the ST and each SR in all of these scenarios. Granting that\ntransmission outage arises when the instantaneous transmission rate is greater\nthan the instantaneous ergodic capacity, we establish two different\ntransmission rate policies for the SUs when the channel is sensed as idle. One\nof these policies features a greedy approach disregarding a possible\ntransmission outage, and the other favors a precautious manner to prevent this\noutage. Subsequently, we determine the effective capacity region of this\nchannel model, and we attain the power allocation policies that maximize this\nregion. Finally, we present the numerical results. We first show the\nsuperiority of Majority rule when the channel sensing results are good.

We consider a cooperative wireless cellular system operating in\ntime-division duplex (TDD) mode, wherein each cooperating cluster includes $B$\nbase-stations (BSs), each equipped with multiple antennas and scheduling $K$\nsingle-antenna users. In an LS-MIMO system, each BS employs $BM$ antennas not\nonly to serve its scheduled users, but also to null out interference caused to\nthe other users within the cooperating cluster using zero-forcing (ZF)\nbeamforming. In a network MIMO system, each BS is equipped with only $M$\nantennas, but interference cancellation is realized by data and channel state\ninformation exchange over the backhaul links and joint downlink transmission\nusing ZF beamforming. Both systems are able to completely eliminate\nintra-cluster interference and to provide the same number of spatial degrees of\nfreedom per user.

They may be inherent to the problem---e.g., in\ndetermining the relationship between genetics and the presence or absence of a\ndisease---or they may be a result of extreme quantization. In one-bit\ncompressed sensing it has recently been shown that the number of one-bit\nmeasurements required for signal estimation mirrors that of unquantized\ncompressed sensing. Indeed, $s$-sparse signals in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ can be\nestimated (up to normalization) from $\\Omega(s \\log (n/s))$ one-bit\nmeasurements. Nevertheless, controlling the precise accuracy of the error\nestimate remains an open challenge. In this paper, we focus on optimizing the\ndecay of the error as a function of the oversampling factor $\\lambda := m/(s\n\\log(n/s))$, where $m$ is the number of measurements. It is known that the\nerror in reconstructing sparse signals from standard one-bit measurements is\nbounded below by $\\Omega(\\lambda^{-1})$. Without adjusting the measurement\nprocedure, reducing this polynomial error decay rate is impossible. However, we\nshow that an adaptive choice of the thresholds used for quantization may lower\nthe error rate to $e^{-\\Omega(\\lambda)}$. This improves upon guarantees for\nother methods of adaptive thresholding as proposed in Sigma-Delta quantization.\nWe develop a general recursive strategy to achieve this exponential decay and\ntwo specific polynomial-time algorithms which fall into this framework, one\nbased on convex programming and one on hard thresholding. This work is inspired\nby the one-bit compressed sensing model, in which the engineer controls the\nmeasurement procedure. Nevertheless, the principle is extendable to signal\nreconstruction problems in a variety of binary statistical models as well as\nstatistical estimation problems like logistic regression.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jul 2014 00:41:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Baraniuk", "Richard", ""], ["Foucart", "Simon", ""], ["Needell", "Deanna", ""], ["Plan", "Yaniv", ""], ["Wootters", "Mary", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.8249", "submitter": "Yixuan Xie", "authors": "Yixuan Xie, Jinhong Yuan and Qifu (Tyler) Sun", "title": "Design of Quantum Stabilizer Codes From Quadratic Residues Sets", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose two types, namely Type-I and Type-II, quantum stabilizer codes\nusing quadratic residue sets of prime modulus given by the form $p=4n\\pm1$.
