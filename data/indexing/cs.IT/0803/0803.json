As opposed to the wiretap channel\nmodel, in which secure communication can be established by exploiting the noise\nin the channel, here the existence of side information at the receiver is used.\nBoth coded and uncoded side information are considered. In the coded side\ninformation scenario, inner and outer bounds on the compression-equivocation\nrate region are given. In the uncoded side information scenario, the\navailability of the legitimate receiver's and the eavesdropper's side\ninformation at the encoder is considered, and the compression-equivocation rate\nregion is characterized for these cases. It is shown that the side information\nat the encoder can increase the equivocation rate at the eavesdropper. Hence,\nthe side information at the encoder is shown to be useful in terms of security;\nthis is in contrast with the pure lossless data compression case where side\ninformation at the encoder would not help.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 8 Mar 2008 00:05:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Gunduz", "Deniz", ""], ["Erkip", "Elza", ""], ["Poor", "H.

However, PCA is well known to behave poorly in the ``large\n$p$, small $n$'' setting, in which the problem dimension $p$ is comparable to\nor larger than the sample size $n$. This paper studies PCA in this\nhigh-dimensional regime, but under the additional assumption that the maximal\neigenvector is sparse, say, with at most $k$ nonzero components. We consider a\nspiked covariance model in which a base matrix is perturbed by adding a\n$k$-sparse maximal eigenvector, and we analyze two computationally tractable\nmethods for recovering the support set of this maximal eigenvector, as follows:\n(a) a simple diagonal thresholding method, which transitions from success to\nfailure as a function of the rescaled sample size\n$\\theta_{\\mathrm{dia}}(n,p,k)=n/[k^2\\log(p-k)]$; and (b) a more sophisticated\nsemidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation, which succeeds once the rescaled\nsample size $\\theta_{\\mathrm{sdp}}(n,p,k)=n/[k\\log(p-k)]$ is larger than a\ncritical threshold. In addition, we prove that no method, including the best\nmethod which has exponential-time complexity, can succeed in recovering the\nsupport if the order parameter $\\theta_{\\mathrm{sdp}}(n,p,k)$ is below a\nthreshold. Our results thus highlight an interesting trade-off between\ncomputational and statistical efficiency in high-dimensional inference.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Mar 2008 23:08:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 26 Aug 2009 05:38:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-26", "authors_parsed": [["Amini", "Arash A.", ""], ["Wainwright", "Martin J.", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.4332", "submitter": "Gusztav Morvai", "authors": "G.

It has long been\nknown through the work of D. Bailey that no universal estimator for\n$\\textbf{P}(X_{n+1}|X_0,X_1,...X_n)$ can be found which converges to the true\nestimator almost surely. Despite this result, for restricted classes of\nprocesses, or for sequences of estimators along stopping times, universal\nestimators can be found. We present here a survey of some of the recent work\nthat has been done along these lines.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Mar 2008 18:07:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Morvai", "G.", ""], ["Weiss", "B.", ""]]}]
