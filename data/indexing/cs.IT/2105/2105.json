In this paper, we investigate an RIS-aided single-cell\nmulti-user mobile edge computing (MEC) system where an RIS is deployed to\nsupport the communication between a base station (BS) equipped with MEC servers\nand multiple single-antenna users. To utilize the scarce frequency resource\nefficiently, we assume that users communicate with BS based on a non-orthogonal\nmultiple access (NOMA) protocol. Each user has a computation task which can be\ncomputed locally or partially/fully offloaded to the BS. We aim to minimize the\nsum energy consumption of all users by jointly optimizing the passive phase\nshifters, the size of transmission data, transmission rate, power control,\ntransmission time and the decoding order. Since the resulting problem is\nnon-convex, we use the block coordinate descent method to alternately optimize\ntwo separated subproblems. More specifically, we use the dual method to tackle\na subproblem with given phase shift and obtain the closed-form solution; and\nthen we utilize penalty method to solve another subproblem for given power\ncontrol.

We propose to build the notion of continual learning\n(CL) into wireless system design, so that the learning model can incrementally\nadapt to the new episodes, {\\it without forgetting} knowledge learned from the\nprevious episodes. Our design is based on a novel bilevel optimization\nformulation which ensures certain ``fairness\" across different data samples. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the CL approach by integrating it with two\npopular DNN based models for power control and beamforming, respectively, and\ntesting using both synthetic and ray-tracing based data sets. These numerical\nresults show that the proposed CL approach is not only able to adapt to the new\nscenarios quickly and seamlessly, but importantly, it also maintains high\nperformance over the previously encountered scenarios as well.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 May 2021 07:23:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-06", "authors_parsed": [["Sun", "Haoran", ""], ["Pu", "Wenqiang", ""], ["Fu", "Xiao", ""], ["Chang", "Tsung-Hui", ""], ["Hong", "Mingyi", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.01747", "submitter": "Pradeep Kr.

The goal is to exactly recover the k\nhidden communities based on the observed hypergraph.

This threshold is represented in terms of a\nquantity which we term as the generalized Chernoff-Hellinger divergence between\ncommunities.

We\nquantify the freshness of status updates when they reach the destination using\nthe concept of Age of Information (AoI). Unlike most of the existing analyses\nof AoI focusing on the evaluation of its average value when the transmitter is\nnot subject to energy constraints, our analysis is focused on understanding the\ndistributional properties of AoI through the characterization of its moment\ngenerating function (MGF). In particular, we use the stochastic hybrid systems\n(SHS) framework to derive closed-form expressions of the MGF of AoI under\nseveral queueing disciplines at the transmitter, including non-preemptive and\npreemptive in service/waiting strategies. Using these MGF results, we further\nobtain closed-form expressions for the first and second moments of AoI in each\nqueueing discipline. We demonstrate the generality of this analysis by\nrecovering several existing results for the corresponding system with no energy\nconstraints as special cases of the new results.

An important concern in CDMM\nis to reduce the recovery threshold $R$ for a given storage/upload constraint.\nRecently, Jeong et al. introduced Approximate MatDot (AMD) codes that are shown\nto improve the recovery threshold by a factor of nearly $2$, from $2p-1$ to\n$p$. A key observation that motivates our work is that the storage/upload\nrequired for approximate computing depends not only on the dimensions of the\n(coded) sub-matrices that are assigned to each server, but also on their\nprecision levels -- a critical aspect that is not explored by Jeong et al. Our\nmain contribution is a dimensional analysis of AMD codes inspired by the\nGeneralized Degrees of Freedom (GDoF) framework previously developed for\nwireless networks, which indicates that for the same upload/storage, once the\nprecision levels of the task assignments are accounted for, AMD codes\nsurprisingly fall short in all aspects to even the trivial replication scheme\nwhich assigns the full computation task to every server.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper on the\nconstruction of LCD MDS codes of non-Reed-Solomon type; any LCD MDS code of\nnon- Reed-Solomon type constructed by our method is not monomially equivalent\nto any LCD code constructed by the method of Carlet et al.

To address this problem, a 2-user Gaussian Z-IC with secrecy\nconstraint at the receiver is considered. One of the fundamental problems here\nis how to use the secret key as a part of the encoding process. The paper\nproposes novel achievable schemes, where the schemes differ from each other\nbased on how the key has been used in the encoding process. The first\nachievable scheme uses one part of the key for one-time pad and remaining part\nof the key for wiretap coding. The encoding is performed such that the receiver\nexperiencing interference can decode some part of the interference without\nviolating the secrecy constraint. As a special case of the derived result, one\ncan obtain the secrecy rate region when the key is completely used for one-time\npad or part of the wiretap coding. The second scheme uses the shared key to\nencrypt the message using one-time pad and in contrast to the previous case no\ninterference is decoded at the receiver. The paper also derives an outer bound\non the sum rate and secrecy rate of the transmitter which causes interference.\nThe main novelty of deriving outer bound lies in the selection of side\ninformation provided to the receiver and using the secrecy constraint at the\nreceiver. The derived outer bounds are found to be tight depending on the\nchannel conditions and rate of the key. The scaling behaviour of key rate is\nalso explored for different schemes using the notion of secure GDOF. The\noptimality of different schemes is characterized for some specific cases.

In contrast to existing work, we use training\ndata which solely stems from the uplink (UL) domain. This allows to learn the\nCNN centralized at the base station (BS). After training, the network\nparameters are offloaded to mobile terminals (MTs) within the coverage area of\nthe BS. The MTs can then obtain channel state information (CSI) of the MIMO\nchannels with the low-complexity CNN estimator. This circumvents the necessity\nof an infeasible amount of feedback, i.e., acquisition of training data at the\nuser, and the offline training phase at each MT. Numerical results show that\nthe CNN which is trained solely based on UL data performs equally well as the\nnetwork trained based on DL data.

This\nwork proposes a novel approach that instead utilizes the magnitude of affine\nmeasurements to achieve ambiguity-free signal reconstruction. The proposed\nmethod relies on two-stage approach that consists of support identification\nfollowed by the exact recovery of nonzero signal entries. In the noise-free\ncase, perfect support identification using a simple counting rule is guaranteed\nsubject to a mild condition on the signal sparsity, and subsequent exact\nrecovery of the nonzero signal entries can be obtained in closed-form. The\nproposed approach is then extended to two noisy scenarios, namely, sparse noise\n(or outliers) and non-sparse bounded noise. For both cases, perfect support\nidentification is still ensured under mild conditions on the noise model,\nnamely, the support size for sparse outliers and the power of the bounded\nnoise. Under perfect support identification, exact signal recovery can be\nachieved using a simple majority rule for the sparse noise scenario, and\nreconstruction up to a bounded error can be achieved using linear least-squares\n(LS) estimation for the non-sparse bounded noise scenario.

Numerical results show that the proposed designs can\nsignificantly reduce the communication latency, as compared to various\nbenchmark schemes, which unveil the importance of user grouping and reflective\nbeamforming optimization for exploiting the joint encoding gain and enhancing\nthe worst-case user performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 May 2021 06:49:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-27", "authors_parsed": [["Xie", "Hailiang", ""], ["Xu", "Jie", ""], ["Liu", "Ya-Feng", ""], ["Liu", "Liang", ""], ["Ng", "Derrick Wing Kwan", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.12456", "submitter": "Jagadeesh Harshan", "authors": "Shilpi Mishra, J.

We discuss observer-dependent emergence and\nasymptotically observer-independent emergence solving some previous suggestions\nindicating a hard distinction between strong and weak emergence.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 May 2021 04:59:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 Jun 2021 22:55:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Abrah\u00e3o", "Felipe S.", ""], ["Zenil", "Hector", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.14754", "submitter": "Chong Shangguan", "authors": "Eitan Goldberg and Chong Shangguan and Itzhak Tamo", "title": "List-decoding and list-recovery of Reed-Solomon codes beyond the Johnson\n  radius for any rate", "comments": "15 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.CO math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Understanding the limits of list-decoding and list-recovery of Reed-Solomon\n(RS) codes is of prime interest in coding theory and has attracted a lot of\nattention in recent decades.
