We propose the PhaseCode algorithm, and show that\nin the noiseless case, PhaseCode can recover an arbitrarily-close-to-one\nfraction of the $K$ non-zero signal components using only slightly more than\n$4K$ measurements when the support of the signal is uniformly random, with\norder-optimal time and memory complexity of $\\Theta(K)$. It is known that the\nfundamental limit for the number of measurements in compressive phase retrieval\nproblem is $4K - o(K)$ to recover the signal exactly and with no assumptions on\nits support distribution. This shows that under mild relaxation of the\nconditions, our algorithm is the first constructive \\emph{capacity-approaching}\ncompressive phase retrieval algorithm: in fact, our algorithm is also\norder-optimal in complexity and memory. Next, motivated by some important\npractical classes of optical systems, we consider a Fourier-friendly\nconstrained measurement setting, and show that its performance matches that of\nthe unconstrained setting. In the Fourier-friendly setting that we consider,\nthe measurement matrix is constrained to be a cascade of Fourier matrices and\ndiagonal matrices. We further demonstrate how PhaseCode can be robustified to\nnoise. Throughout, we provide extensive simulation results that validate the\npractical power of our proposed algorithms for the sparse unconstrained and\nFourier-friendly measurement settings, for noiseless and noisy scenarios. A key\ncontribution of our work is the novel use of coding-theoretic tools like\ndensity evolution methods for the design and analysis of fast and efficient\nalgorithms for compressive phase-retrieval problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jul 2014 21:40:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 31 Mar 2017 00:36:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["Pedarsani", "Ramtin", ""], ["Yin", "Dong", ""], ["Lee", "Kangwook", ""], ["Ramchandran", "Kannan", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.0062", "submitter": "Di Zhang Mr.", "authors": "Di Zhang, Zhenyu Zhou, Keping Yu, Takuro Sato", "title": "Energy Efficiency Scheme with Cellular Partition Zooming for Massive\n  MIMO Systems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Massive multiple-input multiple-output (Massive MIMO) has been realized as a\npromising technology for next generation wireless mobile communications, in\nwhich Spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) are two critical\nissues.

Recently, a number of problems in different application areas\nhave emerged that involve a significantly larger number of subspaces relative\nto the ambient dimension. It becomes imperative in such settings to first\nidentify a smaller set of active subspaces that contribute to the observation\nbefore further processing can be carried out. This problem of identification of\na small set of active subspaces among a huge collection of subspaces from a\nsingle (noisy) observation in the ambient space is termed subspace unmixing.\nThis paper formally poses the subspace unmixing problem under the parsimonious\nsubspace-sum (PS3) model, discusses connections of the PS3 model to problems in\nwireless communications, hyperspectral imaging, high-dimensional statistics and\ncompressed sensing, and proposes a low-complexity algorithm, termed marginal\nsubspace detection (MSD), for subspace unmixing. The MSD algorithm turns the\nsubspace unmixing problem for the PS3 model into a multiple hypothesis testing\n(MHT) problem and its analysis in the paper helps control the family-wise error\nrate of this MHT problem at any level $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$ under two random\nsignal generation models. Some other highlights of the analysis of the MSD\nalgorithm include: (i) it is applicable to an arbitrary collection of subspaces\non the Grassmann manifold; (ii) it relies on properties of the collection of\nsubspaces that are computable in polynomial time; and ($iii$) it allows for\nlinear scaling of the number of active subspaces as a function of the ambient\ndimension.

Given the type of the sequence, the\nrest of the information leakage vanishes exponentially.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Aug 2014 06:21:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-26", "authors_parsed": [["Kang", "Wei", ""], ["Liu", "Nan", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.5674", "submitter": "Yong Li", "authors": "Yong Li, Qianbin Chen, Hongqing Liu, and Trieu-Kien Truong", "title": "Performance and analysis of Quadratic Residue Codes of lengths less than\n  100", "comments": "submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, the performance of quadratic residue (QR) codes of lengths\nwithin 100 is given and analyzed when the hard decoding, soft decoding, and\nlinear programming decoding algorithms are utilized.

In this framework, the relevant solution concept is that of Debreu\nequilibrium, a generalization of Nash equilibrium which accounts for the case\nwhere an agent's set of possible actions depends on the actions of its\nopponents. Since the problem at hand might not be feasible, Debreu equilibria\ndo not always exist. However, using techniques from fractional programming, we\nprovide a characterization of equilibrial power allocation profiles when they\ndo exist.

Moreover, we also describe a set of\nsufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of Debreu equilibria\nexploiting the contraction properties of the best response operator.

We show that the minimum broadcast rate of an index coding problem\nfor different variations of the problem such as non-linear, scalar, and vector\nindex code, can be upper bounded by the minimum broadcast rate of another index\ncoding problem when there exists a homomorphism from the complement of the side\ninformation graph of the first problem to that of the second problem. As a\nresult, we show that several upper bounds on scalar and vector index code\nproblem are special cases of one of our main theorems.\n  For the linear scalar index coding problem, it has been shown in [1] that the\nbinary linear index of a graph is equal to a graph theoretical parameter called\nminrank of the graph. For undirected graphs, in [2] it is shown that\n$\\mathrm{minrank}(G) = k$ if and only if there exists a homomorphism from\n$\\bar{G}$ to a predefined graph $\\bar{G}_k$. Combining these two results, it\nfollows that for undirected graphs, all the digraphs with linear index of at\nmost k coincide with the graphs $G$ for which there exists a homomorphism from\n$\\bar{G}$ to $\\bar{G}_k$. In this paper, we give a direct proof to this result\nthat works for digraphs as well.\n  We show how to use this classification result to generate lower bounds on\nscalar and vector index. In particular, we provide a lower bound for the scalar\nindex of a digraph in terms of the chromatic number of its complement.\n  Using our framework, we show that by changing the field size, linear index of\na digraph can be at most increased by a factor that is independent from the\nnumber of the nodes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Aug 2014 13:46:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Ebrahimi", "Javad B.", ""], ["Siavoshani", "Mahdi Jafari", ""]]}]
