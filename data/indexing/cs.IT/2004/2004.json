This paper proposes the first distributed\nframework for cooperative precoding design in cell-free massive MIMO (and, more\ngenerally, in joint transmission coordinated multi-point) systems that entirely\neliminates the need for backhaul signaling for CSI exchange. A novel\nover-the-air (OTA) signaling mechanism is introduced such that each BS can\nobtain the same cross-term information that is traditionally exchanged among\nthe BSs via backhaul signaling. The proposed distributed precoding design\nenjoys desirable flexibility and scalability properties, as the amount of OTA\nsignaling does not scale with the number of BSs or user equipments. Numerical\nresults show fast convergence and remarkable performance gains as compared with\nnon-cooperative precoding design. The proposed scheme can also outperform the\ncentralized precoding design under realistic CSI acquisition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Apr 2020 09:15:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 7 Aug 2020 09:04:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 13 Oct 2020 15:19:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-14", "authors_parsed": [["Atzeni", "Italo", ""], ["Gouda", "Bikshapathi", ""], ["T\u00f6lli", "Antti", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.00363", "submitter": "Paul Ferrand", "authors": "Paul Ferrand, Alexis Decurninge, Maxime Guillaud", "title": "DNN-based Localization from Channel Estimates: Feature Design and\n  Experimental Results", "comments": "Submitted to Globecom 2020", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.IT cs.LG eess.SP math.IT stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) in the context of channel\nstate information (CSI)-based localization for Massive MIMO cellular systems.\nWe discuss the practical impairments that are likely to be present in practical\nCSI estimates, and introduce a principled approach to feature design for\nCSI-based DNN applications based on the objective of making the features\ninvariant to the considered impairments.

We introduce the problem of distributed encoding, comprising of\n$K\\in\\mathbb{N}$ isolated source nodes and $N\\in\\mathbb{N}$ encoding nodes.\nEach source node has one symbol from a finite field and sends it to all\nencoding nodes. Each encoding node stores an encoded symbol, as a function of\nthe received symbols.

Depending\non the number of adversarial nodes, denoted by $\\beta\\in\\mathbb{N}$, and the\nnumber of symbols that each one generates, denoted by $v\\in\\mathbb{N}$, the\nprocess of decoding from the encoded symbols could be impossible. Assume that a\ndecoder connects to an arbitrary subset of $t \\in\\mathbb{N}$ encoding nodes and\nwants to decode the symbols of the honest nodes correctly, without necessarily\nidentifying the sets of honest and adversarial nodes.

In this paper, to overcome these drawbacks, we consider\nmulti-message communication (MMC) by allowing multiple computations to be\nconveyed from each worker per iteration, and design straggler avoidance\ntechniques accordingly. Then, we analyze how the proposed designs can be\nemployed efficiently to seek a balance between the computation and\ncommunication latency to minimize the overall latency. Furthermore, through\nextensive simulations, both model-based and real implementation on Amazon EC2\nservers, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of these designs in\ndifferent settings, and demonstrate that MMC can help improve upon existing\nstraggler avoidance schemes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 Apr 2020 08:39:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-24", "authors_parsed": [["Ozfatura", "Emre", ""], ["Ulukus", "Sennur", ""], ["Gunduz", "Deniz", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.04985", "submitter": "Mohammad Ali Maddah-Ali Mr.", "authors": "Seyed Reza Hoseini Najarkolaei and Mohammad Ali Maddah-Ali and\n  Mohammad Reza Aref", "title": "Coded Secure Multi-Party Computation for Massive Matrices with\n  Adversarial Nodes", "comments": "41 Pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.CR math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work, we consider the problem of secure multi-party computation\n(MPC), consisting of $\\Gamma$ sources, each has access to a large private\nmatrix, $N$ processing nodes or workers, and one data collector or master. The\nmaster is interested in the result of a polynomial function of the input\nmatrices. Each source sends a randomized functions of its matrix, called as its\nshare, to each worker. The workers process their shares in interaction with\neach other, and send some results to the master such that it can derive the\nfinal result. There are several constraints: (1) each worker can store a\nfunction of each input matrix, with the size of $\\frac{1}{m}$ fraction of that\ninput matrix, (2) up to $t$ of the workers, for some integer $t$, are adversary\nand may collude to gain information about the private inputs or can do\nmalicious actions to make the final result incorrect. The objective is to\ndesign an MPC scheme with the minimum number the workers, called the recovery\nthreshold, such that the final result is correct, workers learn no information\nabout the input matrices, and the master learns nothing beyond the final\nresult. In this paper, we propose an MPC scheme that achieves the recovery\nthreshold of $3t+2m-1$ workers, which is order-wise less than the recovery\nthreshold of the conventional methods.

However, when employed over WSN, the graph filters should deal\nwith the network limited energy, processing, and communication capabilities.\nQuantization plays a fundamental role to improve the latter but its effects on\ndistributed graph filtering are little understood. WSNs are also prone to\nrandom link losses due to noise and interference. The filter output is affected\nby both the quantization error and the topological randomness error, which, if\nit is not properly accounted in the filter design phase, may lead to an\naccumulated error through the filtering iterations and significantly degrade\nthe performance. In this paper, we analyze how quantization affects distributed\ngraph filtering over both time-invariant and time-varying graphs. We bring\ninsights on the quantization effects for the two most common graph filters: the\nfinite impulse response (FIR) and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) graph\nfilter. We devise theoretical performance guarantees on the filter performance\nwhen the quantization stepsize is fixed or changes dynamically over the\nfiltering iterations. For FIR filters, we show that a dynamic quantization\nstepsize leads to more control on the quantization noise than the\nfixed-stepsize quantization. For ARMA graph filters, we show that decreasing\nthe quantization stepsize over the iterations reduces the quantization noise to\nzero at the steady-state. In addition, we propose robust filter design\nstrategies that minimize the quantization noise for both time-invariant and\ntime-varying networks.

Channel feedback is essential in frequency division duplex (FDD)\nRIS-assisted wireless communications, since the downlink channel state\ninformation (CSI) needs to be acquired by the base station (BS) from the user\nequipment (UE) for the joint beamforming at the BS and the RIS. In this paper,\nwe exploit the single-structured sparsity of RIS channel, which means that the\nsparse angular-domain channels of different users share the same structured\nsparsity only in the column dimension, but not in the row dimension. Based on\nthis characteristic, we propose a dimension reduced channel feedback scheme\nwith the low overhead.

We also study the cost-leakage\ntrade-off as an optimization problem using maximal leakage. We demonstrate that\nnot only can this problem be represented as a linear program, but also that\noptimal protection can be achieved using a combination of at most two\ndeterministic schemes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 02:15:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Benjamin", ""], ["Wagner", "Aaron B.", ""], ["Suh", "G.

However, in an IoT, edge computing sessions are often\nephemeral, i.e., they last for a short period of time and can often be\ndiscontinued once the current application usage is completed or the edge\ndevices leave the system due to factors such as mobility. Therefore, in this\npaper, the problem of ephemeral edge computing in an IoT is studied by\nconsidering scenarios in which edge computing operates within a limited time\nperiod. To this end, a novel online framework is proposed in which a source\nedge node offloads its computing tasks from sensors within an area to\nneighboring edge nodes for distributed task computing, within the limited\nperiod of time of an ephemeral edge computing system. The online nature of the\nframework allows the edge nodes to optimize their task allocation and decide on\nwhich neighbors to use for task processing, even when the tasks are revealed to\nthe source edge node in an online manner, and the information on future task\narrivals is unknown. The proposed framework essentially maximizes the number of\ncomputed tasks by jointly considering the communication and computation\nlatency. To solve the problem, an online greedy algorithm is proposed and\nsolved by using the primal-dual approach. Since the primal problem provides an\nupper bound of the original dual problem, the competitive ratio of the online\napproach is analytically derived as a function of the task sizes and the data\nrates of the edge nodes.

Due to the presence of a strong adversary, first, we point out that\ntraditional frequency-hopping does not help since unused frequency bands may\nnot be available, and moreover, the victim's transition between the frequency\nbands would be detected by the full-duplex adversary. Identifying these\nchallenges, we propose a new cooperative mitigation strategy, referred to as\nthe Semi-Coherent Fast-Forward Full-Duplex (SC-FFFD) relaying technique,\nwherein the victim node, upon switching to a new frequency band, seeks the\nassistance of its incumbent user, which is also a full-duplex radio, to\ninstantaneously forward its messages to the destination using a portion of\ntheir powers.

First, the Log-Koopman operator is able to\nreduce the size of observables by transforming multiplicative poly-observable\nto logarithm summation. Second, a nonlinear GFT concept and sampling theory are\nprovided to exploit the nonlinear dependence of observables for Koopman\nlinearized evolution analysis. Combined, the sampling and reconstruction\nalgorithms are designed and demonstrated on two established application areas.\nThe results demonstrate that the proposed Log-Koopman NL-GFT scheme can (i)\nlinearize unknown nonlinear dynamics using $O(N)$ observables, and (ii) achieve\nlower number of sampling nodes, compared with the state-of-the art polynomial\nKoopman linear evolution analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Apr 2020 20:28:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 16 Oct 2020 20:53:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Wei", "Zhuangkun", ""], ["Li", "Bin", ""], ["Sun", "Chengyao", ""], ["Guo", "Weisi", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.09630", "submitter": "Francisco J.

We consider two scenarios with\ndelay-tolerant and delay-sensitive applications, in which the sensors send the\ncommon/shared messages to the UAV via adaptive- and fixed-rate transmissions,\nrespectively. For the two scenarios, we aim to maximize the average data-rate\nthroughput and minimize the transmission outage probability, respectively, by\njointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory design and the sensors' transmit power\nallocation over time, subject to the UAV's flight speed constraints and the\nsensors' individual average power constraints. However, the two formulated\nproblems are both non-convex and thus generally difficult to be optimally\nsolved. To tackle this issue, we first consider the relaxed problems in the\nideal case with the UAV's flight speed constraints ignored, for which the\nwell-structured optimal solutions are obtained to reveal the fundamental\nperformance upper bounds. It is shown that for the two approximate problems,\nthe optimal trajectory solutions have the same multi-location-hovering\nstructure, but with different optimal power allocation strategies. Next, for\nthe general problems with the UAV's flight speed constraints considered, we\npropose efficient algorithms to obtain high-quality solutions by using the\ntechniques from convex optimization and approximation.

To realize this new paradigm, the passive IRSs have to be large,\nespecially for communication in far-field scenarios, so that they can\ncompensate for the large end-to-end path-loss, which is caused by the\nmultiplication of the individual path-losses of the transmitter-to-IRS and\nIRS-to-receiver channels. However, optimizing a large number of sub-wavelength\nIRS elements imposes a significant challenge for online transmission. To\naddress this issue, in this paper, we develop a physics-based model and a\nscalable optimization framework for large IRSs. The basic idea is to partition\nthe IRS unit cells into several subsets, referred to as tiles, model the impact\nof each tile on the wireless channel, and then optimize each tile in two\nstages, namely an offline design stage and an online optimization stage. For\nphysics-based modeling, we borrow concepts from the radar literature, model\neach tile as an anomalous reflector, and derive its impact on the wireless\nchannel for a given phase shift by solving the corresponding integral equations\nfor the electric and magnetic vector fields.

The\nexplicit encoder adds an extra $5\\log n + 5$ bits of redundancy to the\nconstruction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Apr 2020 12:58:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 16 Sep 2020 14:33:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 17 Sep 2020 12:08:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 13 May 2021 07:58:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 1 Jun 2021 10:05:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Bitar", "Rawad", ""], ["Welter", "Lorenz", ""], ["Smagloy", "Ilia", ""], ["Wachter-Zeh", "Antonia", ""], ["Yaakobi", "Eitan", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.14750", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Bob Coecke (University of Oxford), Matthew Leifer (Chapman University)", "title": "Proceedings 16th International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "EPTCS 318, 2020", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.318", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.FL cs.IT cs.PL math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This volume contains the proceedings of the 16th International Conference on\nQuantum Physics and Logic (QPL 2017), which was held June 10-14, 2019.

In particular,\nwe focus on flag codes having maximum minimum distance (optimum distance flag\ncodes). We explore the existence of these codes from spreads, based on the good\nproperties of the latter ones. For $n=2k$, we show that optimum distance full\nflag codes with the largest size are exactly those that can be constructed from\na planar spread.
