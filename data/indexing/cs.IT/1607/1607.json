In\nparticular, a recent breakthrough result of Fazelli, Vardy and Yaakobi\nintroduces the notion of a PIR code and a PIR array code, and uses this notion\nto produce efficient PIR protocols.\n  In this paper we are interested in designing PIR array codes. We consider the\ncase when we have $m$ servers, with each server storing a fraction $(1/s)$ of\nthe bits of the database; here $s$ is a fixed rational number with $s > 1$. A\nPIR array code with the $k$-PIR property enables a $k$-server PIR protocol\n(with $k\\leq m$) to be emulated on $m$ servers, with the overall storage\nrequirements of the protocol being reduced. The communication complexity of a\nPIR protocol reduces as $k$ grows, so the virtual server rate, defined to be\n$k/m$, is an important parameter. We study the maximum virtual server rate of a\nPIR array code with the $k$-PIR property. We present upper bounds on the\nachievable virtual server rate, some constructions, and ideas how to obtain PIR\narray codes with the highest possible virtual server rate. In particular, we\npresent constructions that asymptotically meet our upper bounds, and the exact\nlargest virtual server rate is obtained when $1 < s \\leq 2$.\n  A $k$-PIR code (and similarly a $k$-PIR array code) is also a locally\nrepairable code with symbol availability $k-1$. Such a code ensures $k$\nparallel reads for each information symbol. So the virtual server rate is very\nclosely related to the symbol availability of the code when used as a locally\nrepairable code.

Finally, we develop a novel\n\"bi-dithered\" quantization scheme, which allows for a reduced distortion that\ndecreases when the embedding dimension grows and independently of the\nconsidered pair of vectors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Jul 2016 10:49:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 26 Dec 2016 12:23:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 28 Dec 2016 10:35:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["Jacques", "Laurent", ""], ["Cambareri", "Valerio", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.00853", "submitter": "Tianqing Zhou", "authors": "Tianqing Zhou", "title": "Joint User Association and Power Control for Load Balancing in Downlink\n  Heterogeneous Cellular Networks", "comments": "10 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Instead of achievable rate in the conventional association, we utilize the\neffective rate to design two association schemes for load balancing in\nheterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs), which are both formulated as such\nproblems with maximizing the sum of effective rates.

Our goal is to jointly design the optimal input\ncovariances for the multicast message, confidential message and AN, such that\nthe achievable secrecy rate region is maximized subject to the sum power\nconstraint. This secrecy rate region maximization (SRRM) problem is a nonconvex\nvector maximization problem. To handle it, we reformulate the SRRM problem into\na provably equivalent scalar optimization problem and propose a searching\nmethod to find all of its Pareto optimal points. The equivalent scalar\noptimization problem is identified as a secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem\nwith the quality of multicast service (QoMS) constraints. Further, we show that\nthis equivalent QoMS-constrained SRM problem, albeit nonconvex, can be\nefficiently handled based on a two-stage optimization approach, including\nsolving a sequence of semidefinite programs. Moreover, we also extend the SRRM\nproblem to an imperfect channel state information (CSI) case where a worst-case\nrobust formulation is considered. In particular, while transmit beamforming is\ngenerally a suboptimal technique to the SRRM problem, we prove that it is\noptimal for the confidential message transmission whether in the perfect CSI\nscenario or in the imperfect CSI scenario.

The main focus of this work is on the case when $k=N-1$ relays are\nselected out of the $N$ possible ones. First, a simple algorithm, which removes\nthe relay with the minimum capacity (i.e., the worst relay), is analyzed and it\nis shown that the remaining $(N-1)$-relay subnetwork has an approximate (i.e.,\noptimal up to a constant gap) HD capacity that is at least half of the\napproximate HD capacity of the full network. This fraction guarantee is shown\nto be tight if only the single relay capacities are known, i.e., there exists a\nclass of Gaussian HD diamond networks with $N$ relays where, by removing the\nworst relay, the subnetwork of the remaining $k=N-1$ relays has an approximate\ncapacity equal to half of the approximate capacity of the full network. Next,\nthis work proves a fundamental guarantee, which improves over the previous\nfraction: there always exists a subnetwork of $k=N-1$ relays that achieves at\nleast a fraction $\\frac{N-1}{N}$ of the approximate capacity of the full\nnetwork.

The characterisation of\ncorrelation or joint distribution via Shannon entropy functions is also\napplicable to other information measures such as Renyi entropy and Tsallis\nentropy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Jul 2016 04:56:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-12", "authors_parsed": [["Thakor", "Satyajit", ""], ["Chan", "Terence", ""], ["Grant", "Alex", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.02864", "submitter": "Emrah Akyol", "authors": "Muhammed Sayin, Emrah Akyol, Tamer Basar", "title": "On the Structure of Equilibrium Strategies in Dynamic Gaussian Signaling\n  Games", "comments": "will appear in IEEE Multi-Conference on Systems and Control 2016", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/CCA.2016.7587908", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SY cs.GT cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper analyzes a finite horizon dynamic signaling game motivated by the\nwell-known strategic information transmission problems in economics.

The players\nincur quadratic instantaneous costs as functions of the state, bias and action\nvariables.

The main focus of this work is on the dynamic\n(multi-stage) setting, where we show that the existence of a pure strategy\nStackelberg equilibrium, within the set of linear strategies, depends on the\nproblem parameters.

Though Barron et al. recently\nsucceeded in removing a similar approximation in case of unsupervised learning,\ntheir idea cannot be essentially applied to supervised learning in general. To\novercome this issue, an extension of BC theory to supervised learning is\nproposed. The derived risk bound has several advantages inherited from the\noriginal BC theory. First, the risk bound holds for finite sample size. Second,\nit requires remarkably few assumptions. Third, the risk bound has a form of\nredundancy of the two-stage code for the MDL procedure. Hence, the proposed\nextension gives a mathematical justification of the MDL principle to supervised\nlearning like the original BC theory. As an important example of application,\nnew risk and (probabilistic) regret bounds of lasso with random design are\nderived. The derived risk bound holds for any finite sample size $n$ and\nfeature number $p$ even if $n\\ll p$ without boundedness of features in contrast\nto the past work.

This paper investigates the density of\ncodes in the complex Stiefel and Grassmann manifolds equipped with the chordal\ndistance. The choice of distance enables the treatment of the manifolds as\nsubspaces of Euclidean hyperspheres. In this geometry, the densest packings are\nnot necessarily equivalent to maximum-minimum-distance codes. Computing a\ncode's density follows from computing: i) the normalized volume of a metric\nball and ii) the kissing radius, the radius of the largest balls one can pack\naround the codewords without overlapping. First, the normalized volume of a\nmetric ball is evaluated by asymptotic approximations. The volume of a small\nball can be well-approximated by the volume of a locally-equivalent tangential\nball. In order to properly normalize this approximation, the precise volumes of\nthe manifolds induced by their spherical embedding are computed. For larger\nballs, a hyperspherical cap approximation is used, which is justified by a\nvolume comparison theorem showing that the normalized volume of a ball in the\nStiefel or Grassmann manifold is asymptotically equal to the normalized volume\nof a ball in its embedding sphere as the dimension grows to infinity. Then,\nbounds on the kissing radius are derived alongside corresponding bounds on the\ndensity. Unlike spherical codes or codes in flat spaces, the kissing radius of\nGrassmann or Stiefel codes cannot be exactly determined from its minimum\ndistance. It is nonetheless possible to derive bounds on density as functions\nof the minimum distance. Stiefel and Grassmann codes have larger density than\ntheir image spherical codes when dimensions tend to infinity.

The test outcome of a pool is positive if it contains at\nleast one defective item, and is negative otherwise. GT algorithms are utilized\nin numerous applications, and in many of them maintaining the privacy of the\ntested items, namely, keeping secret whether they are defective or not, is\ncritical.\n  In this paper, we consider a scenario where there is an eavesdropper (Eve)\nwho is able to observe a subset of the GT outcomes (pools). We propose a new\nnon-adaptive Secure Group Testing (SGT) scheme based on information-theoretic\nprinciples. The new proposed test design keeps the eavesdropper ignorant\nregarding the items' status. Specifically, when the fraction of tests observed\nby Eve is $0 \\leq \\delta <1$, we prove that with the naive Maximum Likelihood\n(ML) decoding algorithm the number of tests required for both correct\nreconstruction at the legitimate user (with high probability) and negligible\ninformation leakage to Eve is $\\frac{1}{1-\\delta}$ times the number of tests\nrequired with no secrecy constraint for the fixed $K$ regime.

A popular and\npowerful approach is to exploit the available moment generating function (or\nLaplace transform) of received signal and interference, whenever it exists, by\napplying the Gil-Pelaez inversion formula. However, with the stochastic\ngeometric modeling, the moment generating function may either be too\ncomplicated to exist in closed-form or at worst may not exist.

In\nthe first case, we emphasize the significance of calculating cumulants over\nmoments and exploit the fact that the cumulants of point processes are easily\ncalculable using Campbell's theorem. The SINR outage is then analytically\ncharacterized by Charlier expansion based on Gaussian and Student's\n$t$-distributions and their associated Hermite and Krishnamoorthy polynomials.\nIn the second case, we exploit the saddle point method, which gives a\nsemi-analytical method of calculating the SINR outage, whenever the cumulant\ngenerating function of received signal and interference exists.

This method has huge scientific applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jul 2016 12:59:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["R", "Gautam", ""], ["Murali", "S", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.08455", "submitter": "Shihui Fu", "authors": "Shihui Fu and Xiutao Feng", "title": "Further Results of the Cryptographic Properties on the Butterfly\n  Structures", "comments": "20 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.13154/tosc.v2017.i2.228-249", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.CR math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recently, a new structure called butterfly introduced by Perrin et at. is\nattractive for that it has very good cryptographic properties: the differential\nuniformity is at most equal to 4 and algebraic degree is also very high when\nexponent $e=3$.

To obtain the channel state information (CSI) at the BS\nin FDD systems, the downlink channel has to be estimated by users via downlink\ntraining and then fed back to the BS. For FDD large-scale MIMO systems, the\noverhead for downlink training and CSI uplink feedback could be prohibitively\nhigh, which presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we study the\nbehavior of the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimator when the channel\ncovariance matrix has a low-rank or an approximate low-rank structure. Our\ntheoretical analysis reveals that the amount of training overhead can be\nsubstantially reduced by exploiting the low-rank property of the channel\ncovariance matrix. In particular, we show that the MMSE estimator is able to\nachieve exact channel recovery in the asymptotic low-noise regime, provided\nthat the number of pilot symbols in time is no less than the rank of the\nchannel covariance matrix. We also present an optimal pilot design for the\nsingle-user case, and an asymptotic optimal pilot design for the multi-user\nscenario. Lastly, we develop a simple model-based scheme to estimate the\nchannel covariance matrix, based on which the MMSE estimator can be employed to\nestimate the channel. The proposed scheme does not need any additional training\noverhead. Simulation results are provided to verify our theoretical results and\nillustrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimated covariance-assisted MMSE\nestimator.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jul 2016 15:06:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Fang", "Jun", ""], ["Li", "Xingjian", ""], ["Li", "Hongbin", ""], ["Gao", "Feifei", ""]]}]
