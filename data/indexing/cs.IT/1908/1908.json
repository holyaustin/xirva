In\nparticular, we show that for binary measurements (modelled with Walsh functions\nand Hadamard matrices) and wavelet reconstruction the stable sampling rate is\nlinear. This implies that binary measurements are as efficient as Fourier\nsamples when using wavelets as the reconstruction space. Powerful techniques\nfor reconstructions include generalized sampling and its compressed versions,\nas well as recent methods based on data assimilation. Common to these methods\nis that the reconstruction quality depends highly on the subspace angle between\nthe sampling and the reconstruction space, which is dictated by the stable\nsampling rate.

While\nthe serving DBS follows the same mobility model as the other DBSs in the UIM,\nit is assumed to fly towards the UE of interest in the UDM and hover above its\nlocation after reaching there. The main contribution of this paper is a unified\napproach to characterize the point process of DBSs for all the mobility and\nservice models. Using this, we provide exact mathematical expressions for the\naverage received rate and the session rate as seen by the typical UE. Further,\nusing tools from calculus of variations, we concretely demonstrate that the\nsimple SL mobility model provides a lower bound on the performance of other\ngeneral mobility models (including the ones in which drones follow curved\ntrajectories) as long as the movement of each drone in these models is\nindependent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first work that provides a rigorous analysis of key canonical\nmobility models for an infinite drone cellular network and establishes useful\nconnections between them.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 14 Aug 2019 17:08:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-26", "authors_parsed": [["Banagar", "Morteza", ""], ["Dhillon", "Harpreet S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.05423", "submitter": "Youfa Li", "authors": "Youfa Li and Wenchang Sun", "title": "Random phaseless sampling for causal signals in shift-invariant spaces:\n  a zero distribution perspective", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing,2020", "doi": "10.1109/TSP.2020.3020740", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We proved that the phaseless sampling (PLS) in the linear-phase modulated\nshift-invariant space (SIS) $V(e^{\\textbf{i}\\alpha \\cdot}\\varphi),\n\\alpha\\neq0,$ is impossible even though the real-valued function $\\varphi$\nenjoys the full spark property (so does $e^{\\textbf{i}\\alpha \\cdot}\\varphi$).\nStated another way, the PLS in the complex-generated SISs is essentially\ndifferent from that in the real-generated ones.

To this end, we\nintroduce communication-efficient and privacy-preserving distributed ML\nframeworks, termed fog ML (FML), wherein on-device ML models are trained by\nexchanging model parameters, model outputs, and surrogate data. We then present\nadvanced FML frameworks addressing wireless RAN characteristics, limited\non-device resources, and imbalanced data distributions.

In this paper, an analytical model is\ndeveloped to characterize the performance of FL in wireless networks.\nParticularly, tractable expressions are derived for the convergence rate of FL\nin a wireless setting, accounting for effects from both scheduling schemes and\ninter-cell interference. Using the developed analysis, the effectiveness of\nthree different scheduling policies, i.e., random scheduling (RS), round robin\n(RR), and proportional fair (PF), are compared in terms of FL convergence rate.\nIt is shown that running FL with PF outperforms RS and RR if the network is\noperating under a high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)\nthreshold, while RR is more preferable when the SINR threshold is low.\nMoreover, the FL convergence rate decreases rapidly as the SINR threshold\nincreases, thus confirming the importance of compression and quantization of\nthe update parameters.

These\ninclude new methods for model selection and averaging and hypothesis testing,\nas well as the first completely general definition of {\\em MDL estimators}.\nIncorporating these developments, MDL can be seen as a powerful extension of\nboth penalized likelihood and Bayesian approaches, in which penalization\nfunctions and prior distributions are replaced by more general luckiness\nfunctions, average-case methodology is replaced by a more robust worst-case\napproach, and in which methods classically viewed as highly distinct, such as\nAIC vs BIC and cross-validation vs Bayes can, to a large extent, be viewed from\na unified perspective.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Aug 2019 11:42:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 18 Dec 2019 13:54:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-19", "authors_parsed": [["Gr\u00fcnwald", "Peter", ""], ["Roos", "Teemu", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.08642", "submitter": "Artemy Kolchinsky", "authors": "Artemy Kolchinsky", "title": "A novel approach to multivariate redundancy and synergy", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT q-bio.NC stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Consider a situation in which a set of $n$ \"source\" random variables\n$X_{1},\\dots,X_{n}$ have information about some \"target\" random variable $Y$.\nFor example, in neuroscience $Y$ might represent the state of an external\nstimulus and $X_{1},\\dots,X_{n}$ the activity of $n$ different brain regions.\nRecent work in information theory has considered how to decompose the\ninformation that the sources $X_{1},\\dots,X_{n}$ provide about the target $Y$\ninto separate terms such as (1) the \"redundant information\" that is shared\namong all of sources, (2) the \"unique information\" that is provided only by a\nsingle source, (3) the \"synergistic information\" that is provided by all\nsources only when considered jointly, and (4) the \"union information\" that is\nprovided by at least one source.

In particular, the overarching objective here is to design a\nbeamforming technique maximizing the SEE while satisfying all relevant\nconstraints linked to interference and harvested energy between transmitters\nand receivers. We show that the original problems are non-convex and their\nsolutions are intractable. By using a number of techniques, such as non-linear\nfractional programming and difference of concave (DC) functions, we reformulate\nthe original problems so as to render them tractable. We then combine these\ntechniques with the Dinkelbach's algorithm to derive iterative algorithms to\ndetermine relevant beamforming vectors which lead to the SEE maximization. In\ndoing this, we investigate the robust design with ellipsoidal bounded channel\nuncertainties, by mapping the original problem into a sequence of semidefinite\nprograms by employing the semidefinite relaxation, non-linear fractional\nprogramming and S-procedure.

In the literature, different models have been proposed\nmainly for relatively small and large input power regimes of an EH.

Relying on the\nproposed models in the literature, the learning problem of modulation design\nfor simultaneous wireless information-power transfer (SWIPT) over a\npoint-to-point link is studied. Joint optimization of the transmitter and the\nreceiver is implemented using neural network (NN)-based autoencoders. The\nresults reveal that for relatively small channel input powers, as the power\ndemand increases at the receiver, one of the symbols is shot away from the\norigin while the remaining symbols approach zero amplitude. In the very extreme\ncase of merely receiver power demand, the modulations are in the form of On-Off\nkeying signalling with a low probability of the On signal. On the other side,\nfor relatively large channel input powers, it is observed that as the receiver\npower demand increases, a number of symbols approach zero amplitude, whereas\nthe others (more than one symbol) get equally high amplitudes but with\ndifferent phases. In the extreme scenario of merely receiver power demand, the\nmodulation resembles multiple On-Off keying signalling with different phases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Aug 2019 13:23:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Varasteh", "Morteza", ""], ["Hoydis", "Jakob", ""], ["Clerckx", "Bruno", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.11797", "submitter": "Xiaoyu Zhao", "authors": "Xiaoyu Zhao, Wei Chen, Joohyun Lee, Ness B.
