Here, $p$-dimensional samples are\npresented sequentially, and the goal is to produce the $k$-dimensional subspace\nthat best approximates these points. Standard algorithms require $O(p^2)$\nmemory; meanwhile no algorithm can do better than $O(kp)$ memory, since this is\nwhat the output itself requires. Memory (or storage) complexity is most\nmeaningful when understood in the context of computational and sample\ncomplexity. Sample complexity for high-dimensional PCA is typically studied in\nthe setting of the {\\em spiked covariance model}, where $p$-dimensional points\nare generated from a population covariance equal to the identity (white noise)\nplus a low-dimensional perturbation (the spike) which is the signal to be\nrecovered. It is now well-understood that the spike can be recovered when the\nnumber of samples, $n$, scales proportionally with the dimension, $p$. Yet, all\nalgorithms that provably achieve this, have memory complexity $O(p^2)$.\nMeanwhile, algorithms with memory-complexity $O(kp)$ do not have provable\nbounds on sample complexity comparable to $p$. We present an algorithm that\nachieves both: it uses $O(kp)$ memory (meaning storage of any kind) and is able\nto compute the $k$-dimensional spike with $O(p \\log p)$ sample-complexity --\nthe first algorithm of its kind. While our theoretical analysis focuses on the\nspiked covariance model, our simulations show that our algorithm is successful\non much more general models for the data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Jun 2013 21:38:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Mitliagkas", "Ioannis", ""], ["Caramanis", "Constantine", ""], ["Jain", "Prateek", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.0052", "submitter": "Fang Zhaoxi", "authors": "Zhaoxi Fang, Xin Wang, and Xiaojun Yuan", "title": "Beamforming Design for Multiuser Two-Way Relaying: A Unified Approach\n  via Max-Min SINR", "comments": "31 pages, 9 figures, submitted to IEEE Trans.

In the latter case,\nwe show how to allocate coding bits and transmit power in order to maximize the\ndetection probability, under constraints on the false alarm rate and the global\ntransmit power. Then, we generalize consensus algorithms illustrating a\ndistributed procedure that converges to the projection of the observation\nvector onto a signal subspace.

As a part of our analysis, we model the temporal\ndynamics of the energy level at each BS as a birth-death process, derive the\nenergy utilization rate, and use hitting/stopping time analysis to prove that\nthere exists a fundamental limit on \\rho_k that cannot be surpassed by any\nuncoordinated strategy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Jul 2013 05:29:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["Dhillon", "Harpreet S.", ""], ["Li", "Ying", ""], ["Nuggehalli", "Pavan", ""], ["Pi", "Zhouyue", ""], ["Andrews", "Jeffrey G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.1537", "submitter": "Rusdha Muharar", "authors": "Rusdha Muharar, Randa Zakhour, Jamie Evans", "title": "Optimal Power Allocation and User Loading for Multiuser MISO Channels\n  with Regularized Channel Inversion", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a multiuser system where a single transmitter equipped with\nmultiple antennas (the base station) communicates with multiple users each with\na single antenna.

Using framelet-based\napproach and the notion of discrete affine systems, we shall propose a family\nof tensor product complex tight framelets TPCTF_n for all integers n>2 with\nincreasing directionality, where n refers to the number of filters in the\nunderlying one-dimensional complex tight framelet filter bank. For dimension\ntwo, such tensor product complex tight framelet TPCTF_n offers (n-1)(n-3)/2+4\ndirections when n is odd, and (n-4)(n+2)/2+6 directions when n is even. In\nparticular, TPCTF_4, which is different to DTCWT in both nature and design,\nprovides an alternative to DTCWT. Indeed, TPCTF_4 behaves quite similar to\nDTCWT by offering 6 directions in dimension two, employing the tensor product\nstructure, and enjoying slightly less redundancy than DTCWT. When TPCTF_4 is\napplied to image denoising, its performance is comparable to DTCWT. Moreover,\nbetter results on image denoising can be obtained by using TPCTF_6. Moreover,\nTPCTF_n allows us to further improve DTCWT by using TPCTF_n as the first stage\nfilter bank in DTCWT.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Jul 2013 15:21:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-11", "authors_parsed": [["Han", "Bin", ""], ["Zhao", "Zhenpeng", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.2889", "submitter": "Hessam Mahdavifar", "authors": "Hessam Mahdavifar, Mostafa El-Khamy, Jungwon Lee, Inyup Kang", "title": "Achieving the Uniform Rate Region of General Multiple Access Channels by\n  Polar Coding", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on Communications 64.2 (2016): 467-478", "doi": "10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2507587", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the problem of polar coding for transmission over $m$-user\nmultiple access channels.

In PNC, multiple users\ntransmit to a relay simultaneously. PNC channel decoding is different from\nconventional multi-user channel decoding: specifically, the PNC relay aims to\ndecode a network-coded message rather than the individual messages of the\nusers. Although prior work has shown that PNC can significantly improve the\nthroughput of a relay network, the improvement is predicated on the\navailability of accurate channel estimates. Channel estimation in PNC, however,\ncan be particularly challenging because of 1) the overlapped signals of\nmultiple users; 2) the correlations among data symbols induced by channel\ncoding; and 3) time-varying channels. We combine the expectation-maximization\n(EM) algorithm and belief propagation (BP) algorithm on a unified factor-graph\nframework to tackle these challenges. In this framework, channel estimation is\nperformed by an EM subgraph, and channel decoding is performed by a BP subgraph\nthat models a virtual encoder matched to the target of PNC channel decoding.\nIterative message passing between these two subgraphs allow the optimal\nsolutions for both to be approached progressively.

To meet the\npractical requirement that energy receivers (ERs) operate with significantly\nhigher received power as compared to information receivers (IRs), ERs need to\nbe deployed in more proximity to the transmitter than IRs. However, due to the\nbroadcast nature of wireless channels, one critical issue arises that the\nmessages sent to IRs can be eavesdropped by ERs, which possess better channels\nfrom the transmitter. In this paper, we address this new secrecy communication\nproblem in a multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) SWIPT system where\none multi-antenna transmitter sends information and energy simultaneously to an\nIR and multiple ERs, each with one single antenna. To optimally design transmit\nbeamforming vectors and their power allocation, two problems are investigated\nwith different aims: the first problem maximizes the secrecy rate for IR\nsubject to individual harvested energy constraints of ERs, while the second\nproblem maximizes the weighted sum-energy transferred to ERs subject to a\nsecrecy rate constraint for IR. We solve these two non-convex problems\noptimally by reformulating each of them into a two-stage problem. First, by\nfixing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) target for ERs (for\nthe first problem) or IR (for the second problem), we obtain the optimal\nbeamforming and power allocation solution by applying the technique of\nsemidefinite relaxation (SDR). Then, the original problems are solved by a\none-dimension search over the optimal SINR target for ERs or IR. Furthermore,\nfor each of the two studied problems, suboptimal solutions of lower complexity\nare also proposed in which the information and energy beamforming vectors are\nseparately designed with their power allocation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Jul 2013 14:49:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 26 Jul 2013 05:49:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 17 Jan 2014 07:40:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 21 Jan 2014 08:32:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 22 Jan 2014 15:23:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Liang", ""], ["Zhang", "Rui", ""], ["Chua", "Kee-Chaing", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.6125", "submitter": "Ruoyu Sun", "authors": "Ruoyu Sun, Zhi-Quan Luo", "title": "Interference alignment using finite and dependent channel extensions:\n  the single beam case", "comments": "43 pages.

Using range-only measurements between\nthe sensors and a few anchors (nodes with known absolute positions), and\nwithout using any inertial measurements (e.g., accelerometers), we estimate the\nposition and orientation of the rigid body. For this purpose, the absolute\nposition of the sensors is expressed as an affine function of the Stiefel\nmanifold. In other words, we represent the orientation as a rotation matrix,\nand absolute position as a translation vector. We propose a least-squares (LS),\nsimplified unitarily constrained LS (SUC-LS), and optimal unitarily constrained\nleast-squares (OUC-LS) estimator, where the latter is based on Newton's method.\nAs a benchmark, we derive a unitarily constrained Cram\\'er-Rao bound (UC-CRB).\nThe known topology of the sensors can sometimes be perturbed during\nfabrication. To take these perturbations into account, a simplified unitarily\nconstrained total-least-squares (SUC-TLS), and an optimal unitarily constrained\ntotal-least-squares (OUC-TLS) estimator are also proposed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Jul 2013 16:09:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-25", "authors_parsed": [["Chepuri", "Sundeep Prabhakar", ""], ["Leus", "Geert", ""], ["van der Veen", "Alle-Jan", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.6477", "submitter": "Bubacarr Bah", "authors": "Bubacarr Bah and Jared Tanner", "title": "On construction and analysis of sparse random matrices and expander\n  graphs with applications to compressed sensing", "comments": "4 pages, 6 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:1207.3094", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We revisit the probabilistic construction of sparse random matrices where\neach column has a fixed number of nonzeros whose row indices are drawn\nuniformly at random.
