Our approach is iterative: in each round nodes first perform\nlocal computations and then communicate in order to aggregate information and\nsynchronize their decision variables. Synchronization is accomplished through\nthe use of a distributed averaging protocol. When an exact distributed\naveraging protocol is used, it is known that the optimal regret bound of\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{m})$ can be achieved using the distributed mini-batch\nalgorithm of Dekel et al. (2012), where $m$ is the total number of samples\nprocessed across the network. We focus on methods using approximate distributed\naveraging protocols and show that the optimal regret bound can also be achieved\nin this setting. In particular, we propose a gossip-based optimization method\nwhich achieves the optimal regret bound. The amount of communication required\ndepends on the network topology through the second largest eigenvalue of the\ntransition matrix of a random walk on the network. In the setting of stochastic\noptimization, the proposed gossip-based approach achieves nearly-linear\nscaling: the optimization error is guaranteed to be no more than $\\epsilon$\nafter $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{n \\epsilon^2})$ rounds, each of which involves\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ gossip iterations, when nodes communicate over a\nwell-connected graph. This scaling law is also observed in numerical\nexperiments on a cluster.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Mar 2014 21:32:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 Mar 2014 08:22:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-06", "authors_parsed": [["Tsianos", "Konstantinos I.", ""], ["Rabbat", "Michael G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.0686", "submitter": "Ehsan Soleimani-Nasab", "authors": "E.

We are also able to generalize the result along two\ndirections. First, if the peak of the probability density function is allowed\nto scale as O(P^(\\alpha/2)), representing the concentration of probability\ndensity (improving CSIT) due to, e.g., quantized feedback at rate\n(\\alpha/2)\\log(P), then the DoF are bounded above by 1+\\alpha, which is also\nachievable under quantized feedback. Second, we generalize the result to the K\nuser broadcast channel with K antennas at the transmitter and a single antenna\nat each receiver.

Firstly, users use a fraction of the previously\nharvested energy to send pilots, while the H-AP estimates the uplink channels\nand obtains the downlink channels by exploiting channel reciprocity. Next, the\nH-AP utilizes the channel estimates just obtained to transfer wireless energy\nto all users in the downlink via energy beamforming.

By using the Characteristic\nFunction (CF) approach and the infinitely divisible law, it is proved that,\nother than certain generally recognized curve form {or a stochastic process},\nthe channel service process $S(t)$ is a deterministic linear function of time\n$t$, namely, $S(t)=c_m^\\ast\\cdot t$ where $c_m^\\ast$ is a constant determined\nby the fading parameter $m$. Furthermore, we extend it to general\n\\textit{i.i.d.} fading channels and present an explicit form of the constant\nservice rate $c_p^\\ast$. The obtained work provides such a new insight on the\nsystem design of joint source/channel coding that there exists a coding scheme\nsuch that a receiver can decode with zero error probability and zero high layer\nqueuing delay, if the transmitter maintains a constant data rate no more than\n$c_p^\\ast$.

In the Gaussian many-to-one X channel,\ncommunication links exist between all transmitters and one of the receivers,\nalong with a communication link between each transmitter and its corresponding\nreceiver. As per the X channel assumption, transmission of messages is allowed\non all the links of the channel.

The first two strategies are shown to achieve sum-rate capacity\nunder certain channel conditions.

In contrast to most of existing works that only\nconsider information cooperation, this paper studies joint information and\nenergy cooperation between the two systems, i.e., the primary transmitter sends\ninformation for relaying and feeds the secondary system with energy as well.\nThis is particularly useful when the secondary transmitter has good channel\nquality to the primary receiver but is energy constrained.

In order to\ndetermine the genetic blueprint of an organism, sequencing platforms typically\nemploy so-called shotgun sequencing strategy to oversample the target genome\nwith a library of relatively short overlapping reads. The order of nucleotides\nin the reads is determined by processing the acquired noisy signals generated\nby the sequencing instrument. Assembly of a genome from potentially erroneous\nshort reads is a computationally daunting task even in the scenario where a\nreference genome exists. Errors and gaps in the reference, and perfect repeat\nregions in the target, further render the assembly challenging and cause\ninaccuracies. In this paper, we formulate the reference-guided sequence\nassembly problem as the inference of the genome sequence on a bipartite graph\nand solve it using a message-passing algorithm. The proposed algorithm can be\ninterpreted as the well-known classical belief propagation scheme under a\ncertain prior. Unlike existing state-of-the-art methods, the proposed algorithm\ncombines the information provided by the reads without needing to know\nreliability of the short reads (so-called quality scores).

To\novercome the significant propagation loss over distance, employing\nmulti-antennas at the energy transmitter (ET) to more efficiently direct\nwireless energy to desired energy receivers (ERs), termed \\emph{energy\nbeamforming}, is an essential technique for enabling WET. However, the\nachievable gain of energy beamforming crucially depends on the available\nchannel state information (CSI) at the ET, which needs to be acquired\npractically. In this paper, we study the design of an efficient channel\nacquisition method for a point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)\nWET system by exploiting the channel reciprocity, i.e., the ET estimates the\nCSI via dedicated reverse-link training from the ER. Considering the limited\nenergy availability at the ER, the training strategy should be carefully\ndesigned so that the channel can be estimated with sufficient accuracy, and yet\nwithout consuming excessive energy at the ER. To this end, we propose to\nmaximize the \\emph{net} harvested energy at the ER, which is the average\nharvested energy offset by that used for channel training. An optimization\nproblem is formulated for the training design over MIMO Rician fading channels,\nincluding the subset of ER antennas to be trained, as well as the training time\nand power allocated.

Performance analysis of the SC scheme was\nrecently reported but only for the case of slow-fading channels. This paper\nprovides an exact average bit-error-rate (BER) of the SC scheme over a general\ncase of time-varying Rayleigh fading channels and when the DBPSK modulation is\nused together with the non-coherent detection at the destination. The presented\nanalysis is thoroughly verified with simulation results in various fading\nscenarios. It is shown that the performance of the system is related to the\nauto-correlation values of the channels. It is also shown that the performance\nof the SC method is very close to that of the semi-MRC method and the existence\nof an error floor at high signal-to-noise ratio region is inevitable in both\nmethods. The obtained BER analysis for the SC method can also be used to\napproximate the BER performance of the MRC method, whose exact analytical\nevaluation in time-varying channels appears to be difficult.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Mar 2014 18:46:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Avendi", "M.
