Different from the previous studies on IRS that merely focused on\ntuning the reflection coefficient of all the reflection elements at IRS, in\nthis paper, we consider the true reflection resource management. Specifically,\nthe true reflection resource management can be realized via trigger module\nselection based on our proposed IRS architecture that all the reflection\nelements are partially controlled by multiple parallel switches of controller.\nAs the number of reflection elements increases, the true reflection resource\nmanagement will become urgently needed in this context, which is due to the\nnon-ignorable energy consumption. Moreover, the proposed modular architecture\nof IRS is designed to make the reflection elements part independent and\ncontrollable. As such, our goal is to maximize the minimum\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at DTs via a joint trigger\nmodule subset selection, transmit power allocation of STs, and the\ncorresponding passive beamforming of the trigger modules, subject to per ST\npower budgets and module size constraint. Whereas this problem is NP-hard due\nto the module size constraint, to deal with it, we transform the hard module\nsize constraint into the group sparse constraint by introducing the mixed row\nblock norm, which yields a suitable semidefinite relaxation. Additionally, the\nparallel alternating direction method of multipliers (PADMM) is proposed to\nidentify the trigger module subset, and then subsequently the transmit power\nallocation and passive beamforming can be obtained by solving the original\nminimum SINR maximization problem without the group sparse constraint via\npartial linearization for generalized fractional programs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Feb 2020 05:15:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 30 Sep 2020 17:28:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Gao", "Yulan", ""], ["Yong", "Chao", ""], ["Xiong", "Zehui", ""], ["Zhao", "Jun", ""], ["Xiao", "Yue", ""], ["Niyato", "Dusit", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.00375", "submitter": "Yang Yan", "authors": "Qiuyan Wang, Weigang Kong, Yang Yan, Chenhuang Wu, Minghui Yang", "title": "Autocorrelation of a class of quaternary sequences of period $2p^m$", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT math.NT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Sequences with good randomness properties are quite important for stream\nciphers.

Unfortunately, such queries can be expensive or\ntime-consuming, mandating the careful consideration of which node pairs to\nquery. In this paper we estimate the improvement in link prediction accuracy\nafter querying any particular node pair, to use in an active learning setup.\nSpecifically, we propose ALPINE (Active Link Prediction usIng Network\nEmbedding), the first method to achieve this for link prediction based on\nnetwork embedding. To this end, we generalized the notion of V-optimality from\nexperimental design to this setting, as well as more basic active learning\nheuristics originally developed in standard classification settings. Empirical\nresults on real data show that ALPINE is scalable, and boosts link prediction\naccuracy with far fewer queries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Feb 2020 11:09:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Xi", ""], ["Kang", "Bo", ""], ["Lijffijt", "Jefrey", ""], ["De Bie", "Tijl", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.01255", "submitter": "Zhiyuan Jiang", "authors": "Zhiyuan Jiang, Zixu Cao, Siyu Fu, Fei Peng, Shan Cao, Shunqing Zhang,\n  and Shugong Xu", "title": "Revealing Much While Saying Less: Predictive Wireless for Status Update", "comments": "To appear in IEEE INFOCOM 2020", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.NI eess.SP math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Wireless communications for status update are becoming increasingly\nimportant, especially for machine-type control applications.

One of the classical bottlenecks of point-to-point MIMO\ncommunications is that the capacity gains provided by spatial multiplexing are\nonly large at high SNR, and high SNR channels are mainly appearing in\nline-of-sight (LoS) scenarios where the channel matrix has low rank and\ntherefore does not support spatial multiplexing. We demonstrate how an IRS can\nbe used and optimized in such scenarios to increase the rank of the channel\nmatrix, leading to substantial capacity gains.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Feb 2020 10:07:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["\u00d6zdogan", "\u00d6zgecan", ""], ["Bj\u00f6rnson", "Emil", ""], ["Larsson", "Erik G.", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.02187", "submitter": "YuTing Liu", "authors": "Yu-Ting Liu", "title": "On the Fairness of Name-Based Rationing System for Purchases of Masks\n  Policy", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, mathematical model and condition are built for the analysis of\nfairness of name-based rationing system for purchases of masks policy announced\nand launched in Taiwan.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Feb 2020 10:30:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 7 Feb 2020 16:13:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-10", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Yu-Ting", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.02220", "submitter": "Couvreur Alain", "authors": "Alain Couvreur, Philippe Lebacque, Marc Perret", "title": "Toward good families of codes from towers of surfaces", "comments": "In memory of Gilles Lachaud.

To tackle this issue,\nwe propose a novel two-phase transmission protocol by exploiting cellular plus\ndevice-to-device (D2D) communication for the UAV swarm. In Phase I, one swarm\nhead is chosen for ground-to-air channel estimation, and all the GBSs that are\nnot serving ground users (available GBSs) transmit a common control message to\nthe UAV swarm simultaneously, using the same cellular frequency band, to combat\nthe strong interference from occupied GBSs. In Phase II, all the UAVs that have\ndecoded the common control message in Phase I further relay it to the other\nUAVs in the swarm via D2D communication, by exploiting the less interfered D2D\nfrequency band and the proximity among UAVs.

As a result, the\nmaximal-ratio combining (MRC) receive beamforming strategy leads to strong\ninter-user interference and thus even lower user rates than those of the\nmassive MIMO system without IRS.

For some applications, computational expensive and time consuming\ndata processing is inevitable for status information of messages to be\ndisplayed. Mobile edge servers are equipped with adequate computation resources\nand they are placed close to users. Thus, mobile edge computing (MEC) can be a\npromising technology to reduce AoI for computation-intensive messages. In this\npaper, we study the AoI for computation-intensive messages with MEC, and\nconsider three computing schemes: local computing, remote computing at the MEC\nserver, and partial computing, i.e., some part of computing tasks are performed\nlocally, and the rest is executed at the MEC server. Zero-wait policy is\nadopted in all three schemes. Specifically, in local computing, a new message\nis generated immediately after the previous one is revealed by computing. While\nin remote computing and partial computing, a new message is generated once the\nprevious one is received by the remote MEC server. With infinite queue size and\nexponentially distributed transmission time, closed-form average AoI for\nexponentially distributed computing time is derived for the three computing\nschemes. For deterministic computing time, the average AoI is analyzed\nnumerically. Simulation results show that by carefully partitioning the\ncomputing tasks, the average AoI in partial computing is the smallest compared\nto local computing and remote computing. The results also indicate numerically\nthe conditions on which remote computing attains smaller average AoI compared\nwith local computing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 15 Feb 2020 15:45:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-19", "authors_parsed": [["Kuang", "Qiaobin", ""], ["Gong", "Jie", ""], ["Chen", "Xiang", ""], ["Ma", "Xiao", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.06407", "submitter": "Elias Javier Garcia Claro E.

Furthermore, the techniques of message\nstrength normalization can naturally be applied to these single-valued messages\nto improve the performance.

This requires a paradigm shift towards the development of innovative\ntechnologies for next generation wireless systems. One of the key challenges is\nthe scarcity of spectrum, owing to the unprecedented broadband penetration rate\nin recent years. A promising solution is the proposal of visible light\ncommunications (VLC), which explores the unregulated visible light spectrum to\nenable high-speed communications, in addition to efficient lighting. This\nsolution offers a wider bandwidth that can accommodate ubiquitous broadband\nconnectivity to indoor users and offload data traffic from cellular networks.\nAlthough VLC is secure and able to overcome the shortcomings of RF systems, it\nsuffers from several limitations, e.g., limited modulation bandwidth. In this\nrespect, solutions have been proposed recently to overcome this limitation. In\nparticular, most common orthogonal and non-orthogonal multiple access\ntechniques initially proposed for RF systems, e.g., space-division multiple\naccess (SDMA) and NOMA, have been considered in the context of VLC. In spite of\ntheir promising gains, the performance of these techniques is somewhat limited.\nConsequently, in this article a new and generalized multiple access technique,\ncalled rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), is introduced and investigated\nfor the first time in VLC networks. We first provide an overview of the key\nmultiple access technologies used in VLC systems. Then, we propose the first\ncomprehensive approach to the integration of RSMA with VLC systems.

In this paper, we propose\na massive MIMO transmission scheme with full frequency reuse (FFR) for LEO\nsatellite communication systems and exploit statistical channel state\ninformation (sCSI) to address the difficulty of obtaining instantaneous CSI\n(iCSI) at the transmitter. We first establish the massive MIMO channel model\nfor LEO satellite communications and simplify the transmission designs via\nperforming Doppler and delay compensations at user terminals (UTs).

It is shown that\nthe DL ASLNRs and UL ASINRs of all UTs reach their upper bounds under some\nchannel condition. Motivated by this, we propose a space angle based user\ngrouping (SAUG) algorithm to schedule the served UTs into different groups,\nwhere each group of UTs use the same time and frequency resource. The proposed\nalgorithm is asymptotically optimal in the sense that the lower and upper\nbounds of the achievable rate coincide when the number of satellite antennas or\nUT groups is sufficiently large.

By\nstudying the mutual information between the function learned by a VAE on the\noriginal data and on the augmented data we show that MixUp distorts learned\nfunctions in a way that CutMix does not. We further demonstrate this by showing\nthat MixUp acts as a form of adversarial training, increasing robustness to\nattacks such as Deep Fool and Uniform Noise which produce examples similar to\nthose generated by MixUp. We argue that this distortion prevents models from\nlearning about sample specific features in the data, aiding generalisation\nperformance. In contrast, we suggest that CutMix works more like a traditional\naugmentation, improving performance by preventing memorisation without\ndistorting the data distribution. However, we argue that an MSDA which builds\non CutMix to include masks of arbitrary shape, rather than just square, could\nfurther prevent memorisation whilst preserving the data distribution in the\nsame way. To this end, we propose FMix, an MSDA that uses random binary masks\nobtained by applying a threshold to low frequency images sampled from Fourier\nspace. These random masks can take on a wide range of shapes and can be\ngenerated for use with one, two, and three dimensional data. FMix improves\nperformance over MixUp and CutMix, without an increase in training time, for a\nnumber of models across a range of data sets and problem settings, obtaining a\nnew single model state-of-the-art result on CIFAR-10 without external data.\nFinally, we show that a consequence of the difference between interpolating\nMSDA such as MixUp and masking MSDA such as FMix is that the two can be\ncombined to improve performance even further.
