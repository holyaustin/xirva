Subsequently, code\npairs based on Trellis Coded Modulation (TCM) are designed for the two-user\nGMAC with $M$-PSK and $M$-PAM alphabet pairs for arbitrary values of $M$ and it\nis proved that, for certain angles of rotation, Ungerboeck labelling on the\ntrellis of each user maximizes the guaranteed squared Euclidean distance of the\n\\textit{sum trellis}. Hence, such a labelling scheme can be used systematically\nto construct trellis code pairs for a two-user GMAC to achieve sum rates close\nto the sum capacity of the channel.

Simulation of both coded and uncoded systems\nshows that the receiver performs significantly better than conventional\nreceivers with linear channel estimation, and is robust with respect to\nmismatch in the assumed fading model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 11 Jan 2009 02:14:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 15 Oct 2009 19:06:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-15", "authors_parsed": [["Zhu", "Yan", ""], ["Guo", "Dongning", ""], ["Honig", "Michael L.", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.1444", "submitter": "Shrinivas Kudekar Mr.", "authors": "Dinkar Vasudevan and Shrinivas Kudekar", "title": "Algebraic gossip on Arbitrary Networks", "comments": "Paper has been withdrawn due to an error in the main proof", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Consider a network of nodes where each node has a message to communicate to\nall other nodes.

Central to our results is a discrete-time distributed randomized\nalgorithm which is based on a generalization of the so-called Glauber dynamics\nfrom statistical physics, where multiple links are allowed to update their\nstates in a single time slot. The algorithm generates collision-free\ntransmission schedules while explicitly taking collisions into account during\nthe control phase of the protocol, thus relaxing the perfect CSMA assumption.\nMore importantly, the algorithm allows us to incorporate mechanisms which lead\nto very good delay performance while retaining the throughput-optimality\nproperty.

Second, empirical estimates of several IPMs\nfrom finite i.i.d. samples are obtained, and their consistency and convergence\nrates are analyzed. These estimators are shown to be easily computable, with\nbetter rates of convergence than estimators of $\\phi$-divergences. Third, a\nnovel interpretation is provided for IPMs by relating them to binary\nclassification, where it is shown that the IPM between class-conditional\ndistributions is the negative of the optimal risk associated with a binary\nclassifier. In addition, the smoothness of an appropriate binary classifier is\nproved to be inversely related to the distance between the class-conditional\ndistributions, measured in terms of an IPM.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 18 Jan 2009 13:20:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 30 Jul 2009 09:31:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 19 Aug 2009 18:06:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 13 Oct 2009 03:15:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-13", "authors_parsed": [["Sriperumbudur", "Bharath K.", ""], ["Fukumizu", "Kenji", ""], ["Gretton", "Arthur", ""], ["Sch\u00f6lkopf", "Bernhard", ""], ["Lanckriet", "Gert R.

It is known that the MIMO secrecy capacity is\nachievable with the optimal transmit covariance matrix that maximizes the\nminimum difference between the channel mutual information of the secrecy user\nand those of the eavesdroppers. The MIMO secrecy capacity computation can thus\nbe formulated as a non-convex max-min problem, which cannot be solved\nefficiently by standard convex optimization techniques. To handle this\ndifficulty, we explore a relationship between the MIMO secrecy channel and the\nrecently developed MIMO cognitive radio (CR) channel, in which the\nmulti-antenna secondary user transmits over the same spectrum simultaneously\nwith multiple primary users, subject to the received interference power\nconstraints at the primary users, or the so-called ``interference temperature\n(IT)'' constraints. By constructing an auxiliary CR MIMO channel that has the\nsame channel responses as the MIMO secrecy channel, we prove that the optimal\ntransmit covariance matrix to achieve the secrecy capacity is the same as that\nto achieve the CR spectrum sharing capacity with properly selected IT\nconstraints. Based on this relationship, several algorithms are proposed to\nsolve the non-convex secrecy capacity computation problem by transforming it\ninto a sequence of CR spectrum sharing capacity computation problems that are\nconvex. For the case with single-antenna eavesdroppers, the proposed algorithms\nobtain the exact capacity of the MIMO secrecy channel, while for the case with\nmulti-antenna eavesdroppers, the proposed algorithms obtain both upper and\nlower bounds on the MIMO secrecy capacity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Jan 2009 06:56:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Lan", ""], ["Zhang", "Rui", ""], ["Liang", "Ying-Chang", ""], ["Xin", "Yan", ""], ["Cui", "Shuguang", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.4898", "submitter": "Rui Costa", "authors": "Joao Barros, Rui A.

Based on a general\nanalytical framework for evaluating the decoding delay, we show that existing\nARQ schemes fail to ensure that receivers with weak channels are able to\nrecover from packet losses within reasonable time. To overcome this problem, we\nre-define the encoding rules in order to break the chains of linear\ncombinations that cannot be decoded after one of the packets is lost. Our\nresults show that sending uncoded packets at key times ensures that all the\nreceivers are able to meet specific delay requirements with very high\nprobability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Jan 2009 15:00:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Barros", "Joao", ""], ["Costa", "Rui A.", ""], ["Munaretto", "Daniele", ""], ["Widmer", "Joerg", ""]]}]
