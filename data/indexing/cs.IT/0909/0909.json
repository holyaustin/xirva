In this paper a modification\nof Hoeffding's test is considered based on a relaxation of the K-L divergence\ntest statistic, referred to as the mismatched divergence. The resulting\nmismatched test is shown to be a generalized likelihood-ratio test (GLRT) for\nthe case where the alternate distribution lies in a parametric family of the\ndistributions characterized by a finite dimensional parameter, i.e., it is a\nsolution to the corresponding composite hypothesis testing problem. For certain\nchoices of the alternate distribution, it is shown that both the Hoeffding test\nand the mismatched test have the same asymptotic performance in terms of error\nexponents. A consequence of this result is that the GLRT is optimal in\ndifferentiating a particular distribution from others in an exponential family.\nIt is also shown that the mismatched test has a significant advantage over the\nHoeffding test in terms of finite sample size performance. This advantage is\ndue to the difference in the asymptotic variances of the two test statistics\nunder the null hypothesis. In particular, the variance of the K-L divergence\ngrows linearly with the alphabet size, making the test impractical for\napplications involving large alphabet distributions. The variance of the\nmismatched divergence on the other hand grows linearly with the dimension of\nthe parameter space, and can hence be controlled through a prudent choice of\nthe function class defining the mismatched divergence.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Sep 2009 18:35:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 28 Apr 2010 16:49:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 9 Sep 2010 06:56:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Unnikrishnan", "Jayakrishnan", ""], ["Huang", "Dayu", ""], ["Meyn", "Sean", ""], ["Surana", "Amit", ""], ["Veeravalli", "Venugopal", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.2292", "submitter": "Wei E.I.

In wireless networks, the channel of a user is not fixed but varies\nrandomly. Thus, in order to maximize the throughput of the MAC protocol at any\ngiven time, only users with large channel gains should be allowed to transmit.\nIn this paper, compressive sensing based opportunistic protocol for throughput\nimprovement in wireless networks is proposed. The protocol is based on the\ntraditional protocol of R-ALOHA which allows users to compete for channel\naccess before reserving the channel to the best user. We use compressive\nsensing to find the best user, and show that the proposed protocol requires\nless time for reservation and so it outperforms other schemes proposed in\nliterature. This makes the protocol particularly suitable for enhancing R-ALOHA\nin fast fading environments.

In spite of their existence, little is known on how to\nconstruct such encoders in practice. This paper is devoted to their\nconstruction. In particular, two families of linear encoders are presented and\nproved to have good joint spectra. The first family is derived from Gabidulin\ncodes, a class of maximum-rank-distance codes. The second family is constructed\nusing a serial concatenation of an encoder of a low-density parity-check code\n(as outer encoder) with a low-density generator matrix encoder (as inner\nencoder). In addition, criteria for good linear encoders are defined for three\ncoding applications: lossless source coding, channel coding, and lossless JSCC.\nIn the framework of the code-spectrum approach, these three scenarios\ncorrespond to the problems of constructing linear encoders with good kernel\nspectra, good image spectra, and good joint spectra, respectively. Good joint\nspectra imply both good kernel spectra and good image spectra, and for every\nlinear encoder having a good kernel (resp., image) spectrum, it is proved that\nthere exists a linear encoder not only with the same kernel (resp., image) but\nalso with a good joint spectrum.

First, we study the multiple-input\nsingle-output (MISO) finite state compound broadcast channel (BC) with\narbitrary number of users and antennas at the transmitter. In prior work,\nWeingarten et. al. have found inner and outer bounds on the DoF with 2 users.\nThe bounds have a different character. While the inner bound collapses to unity\nas the number of states increases, the outer bound does not diminish with the\nincreasing number of states beyond a threshold value. It has been conjectured\nthat the outer bound is loose and the inner bound represents the actual DoF. In\nthe complex setting (all signals, noise, and channel coefficients are complex\nvariables) we solve a few cases to find that the outer bound -and not the inner\nbound- of Weingarten et. al. is tight. For the real setting (all signals, noise\nand channel coefficients are real variables) we completely characterize the\nDoF, once again proving that the outer bound of Weingarten et. al. is tight. We\nalso extend the results to arbitrary number of users. Second, we characterize\nthe DoF of finite state scalar (single antenna nodes) compound X networks with\narbitrary number of users in the real setting. Third, we characterize the DoF\nof finite state scalar compound interference networks with arbitrary number of\nusers in both the real and complex setting. The key finding is that scalar\ninterference networks and (real) X networks do not lose any DoF due to channel\nuncertainty at the transmitter in the finite state compound setting. The finite\nstate compound MISO BC does lose DoF relative to the perfect CSIT scenario.\nHowever, what is lost is only the DoF benefit of joint processing at transmit\nantennas, without which the MISO BC reduces to an X network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Sep 2009 19:59:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-24", "authors_parsed": [["Gou", "Tiangao", ""], ["Jafar", "Syed A.", ""], ["Wang", "Chenwei", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.4203", "submitter": "Amos Lapidoth", "authors": "Young-Han Kim, Amos Lapidoth, and Tsachy Weissman", "title": "Error Exponents for the Gaussian Channel with Active Noisy Feedback", "comments": "Submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the best exponential decay in the blocklength of the probability of\nerror that can be achieved in the transmission of a single bit over the\nGaussian channel with an active noisy Gaussian feedback link.

They showed that the value of the minimum cut is\nin this case the minimum rank of all the adjacency matrices describing\nsource-destination cuts.\n  In this paper, we develop a polynomial time algorithm that discovers the\nrelay encoding strategy to achieve the min-cut value in linear deterministic\n(wireless) networks, for the case of a unicast connection. Our algorithm\ncrucially uses a notion of linear independence between channels to calculate\nthe capacity in polynomial time. Moreover, we can achieve the capacity by using\nvery simple one-symbol processing at the intermediate nodes, thereby\nconstructively yielding finite length strategies that achieve the unicast\ncapacity of the linear deterministic (wireless) relay network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Sep 2009 21:33:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Ebrahimi", "Javad", ""], ["Fragouli", "Christina", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.4828", "submitter": "Ofer Shayevitz", "authors": "Ofer Shayevitz and Meir Feder", "title": "Optimal Feedback Communication via Posterior Matching", "comments": "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we introduce a fundamental principle for optimal communication\nover general memoryless channels in the presence of noiseless feedback, termed\nposterior matching.

The\nrequired feedback of channel state information (CSI) can potentially result in\nexcessive overhead especially for high mobility or many antennas. This work\nconcerns efficient feedback for transmit beamforming and establishes a new\napproach of controlling feedback for maximizing net throughput, defined as\nthroughput minus average feedback cost. The feedback controller using a\nstationary policy turns CSI feedback on/off according to the system state that\ncomprises the channel state and transmit beamformer. Assuming channel isotropy\nand Markovity, the controller's state reduces to two scalars. This allows the\noptimal control policy to be efficiently computed using dynamic programming.\nConsider the perfect feedback channel free of error, where each feedback\ninstant pays a fixed price. The corresponding optimal feedback control policy\nis proved to be of the threshold type. This result holds regardless of whether\nthe controller's state space is discretized or continuous. Under the\nthreshold-type policy, feedback is performed whenever a state variable\nindicating the accuracy of transmit CSI is below a threshold, which varies with\nchannel power. The practical finite-rate feedback channel is also considered.\nThe optimal policy for quantized feedback is proved to be also of the threshold\ntype. The effect of CSI quantization is shown to be equivalent to an increment\non the feedback price. Moreover, the increment is upper bounded by the expected\nlogarithm of one minus the quantization error. Finally, simulation shows that\nfeedback control increases net throughput of the conventional periodic feedback\nby up to 0.5 bit/s/Hz without requiring additional bandwidth or antennas.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Sep 2009 01:14:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Kaibin", ""], ["Lau", "Vincent K.

In this paper we propose a simple and fast algorithm SVP (Singular\nValue Projection) for rank minimization with affine constraints (ARMP) and show\nthat SVP recovers the minimum rank solution for affine constraints that satisfy\nthe \"restricted isometry property\" and show robustness of our method to noise.\nOur results improve upon a recent breakthrough by Recht, Fazel and Parillo\n(RFP07) and Lee and Bresler (LB09) in three significant ways:\n  1) our method (SVP) is significantly simpler to analyze and easier to\nimplement,\n  2) we give recovery guarantees under strictly weaker isometry assumptions\n  3) we give geometric convergence guarantees for SVP even in presense of noise\nand, as demonstrated empirically, SVP is significantly faster on real-world and\nsynthetic problems.\n  In addition, we address the practically important problem of low-rank matrix\ncompletion (MCP), which can be seen as a special case of ARMP. We empirically\ndemonstrate that our algorithm recovers low-rank incoherent matrices from an\nalmost optimal number of uniformly sampled entries. We make partial progress\ntowards proving exact recovery and provide some intuition for the strong\nperformance of SVP applied to matrix completion by showing a more restricted\nisometry property. Our algorithm outperforms existing methods, such as those of\n\\cite{RFP07,CR08,CT09,CCS08,KOM09,LB09}, for ARMP and the matrix-completion\nproblem by an order of magnitude and is also significantly more robust to\nnoise.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Sep 2009 14:44:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 19 Oct 2009 19:32:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 19 Oct 2009 21:21:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-20", "authors_parsed": [["Meka", "Raghu", ""], ["Jain", "Prateek", ""], ["Dhillon", "Inderjit S.", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.5507", "submitter": "Cuizhu Shi", "authors": "Cuizhu Shi and Aditya Ramamoorthy", "title": "Fast Algorithm for Finding Unicast Capacity of Linear Deterministic\n  Wireless Relay Networks", "comments": "27 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The deterministic channel model for wireless relay networks proposed by\nAvestimehr, Diggavi and Tse `07 has captured the broadcast and inference nature\nof wireless communications and has been widely used in approximating the\ncapacity of wireless relay networks. The authors generalized the max-flow\nmin-cut theorem to the linear deterministic wireless relay networks and\ncharacterized the unicast capacity of such deterministic network as the minimum\nrank of all the binary adjacency matrices describing source-destination cuts\nwhose number grows exponentially with the size of the network. In this paper,\nwe developed a fast algorithm for finding the unicast capacity of a linear\ndeterministic wireless relay network by finding the maximum number of linearly\nindependent paths using the idea of path augmentation. We developed a modified\ndepth-first search algorithm tailored for the linear deterministic relay\nnetworks for finding linearly independent paths whose total number proved to\nequal the unicast capacity of the underlying network. The result of our\nalgorithm suggests a capacity-achieving transmission strategy with one-bit\nlength linear encoding at the relay nodes in the concerned linear deterministic\nwireless relay network.
