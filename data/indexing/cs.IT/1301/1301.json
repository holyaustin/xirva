The important case of $F$-minimization has\nbecome of particular interest, for which the exact reconstruction condition\n(ERC) in the noiseless setting can be precisely characterized by the null space\nproperty (NSP). However, little work has been done concerning its robust\nreconstruction condition (RRC) in the noisy setting. We look at the null space\nof the measurement matrix as a point on the Grassmann manifold, and then study\nthe relation between the ERC and RRC sets, denoted as $\\Omega_J$ and\n$\\Omega_J^r$, respectively.

It is shown that, in order to approach the rate performance\nachievable by an unstructured codebook with maximum-likelihood decoding, it is\ncrucial to use a new K-stage coset decoder for structured O-MLC, instead of the\none-stage decoder proposed in previous works. However, if O-MLC is decoded with\nthe one-stage decoder only, it can still achieve the optimal DDF\ndiversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime.\nAs for MS-MLC, its rate performance can approach that of the O-MLC by\nincreasing the complexity of the modulo-sum relay-mapper.

A major obstacle that poses an existential threat to practical\ndeployment of conventional approaches to distributed coding is the exponential\ngrowth of the decoder complexity with the number of sources and the encoding\nrates. This growth in complexity renders many traditional approaches\nimpractical even for moderately sized networks. In this paper, we propose a new\ndecoding paradigm for large scale distributed compression wherein the decoder\ncomplexity is explicitly controlled during the design. Central to our approach\nis a module called the \"bit-subset selector\" whose role is to judiciously\nextract an appropriate subset of the received bits for decoding per individual\nsource. We propose a practical design strategy, based on deterministic\nannealing (DA) for the joint design of the system components, that enables\ndirect optimization of the decoder complexity-distortion trade-off, and thereby\nthe desired scalability. We also point out the direct connections between the\nproblem of large scale distributed compression and a related problem in sensor\nnetworks, namely, dispersive information routing of correlated sources. This\nallows us to extend the design principles proposed in the context of large\nscale distributed compression to design efficient routers for minimum cost\ncommunication of correlated sources across a network.

Specifically, the SU transmits in the null space of the interference\nchannel to the PU. We present a new algorithm, called the One-Bit Null Space\nLearning Algorithm (OBNSLA), in which the SU learns the PU's null space by\nobserving a binary function that indicates whether the interference it inflicts\non the PU has increased or decreased in comparison to the SU's previous\ntransmitted signal. This function is obtained by listening to the PU\ntransmitted signal or control channel and extracting information from it about\nwhether the PU's Signal to Interference plus Noise power Ratio (SINR) has\nincreased or decreased.\n  In addition to introducing the OBNSLA, this paper provides a thorough\nconvergence analysis of this algorithm. The OBNSLA is shown to have a linear\nconvergence rate and an asymptotic quadratic convergence rate. Finally, we\nderive bounds on the interference that the SU inflicts on the PU as a function\nof a parameter determined by the SU. This lets the SU control the maximum level\nof interference, which enables it to protect the PU completely blindly with\nminimum complexity.

In this paper we propose a\ncoding theoretic variation of PPM that allows for significantly more efficient\nsymbol and frame synchronization as well as strong error correction. The\nproposed scheme can be divided into a synchronization layer and a modulation\nlayer. This makes our technique compatible with major existing techniques such\nas standard PPM, multipluse PPM, and expurgated PPM as well in that the scheme\ncan be realized by adding a simple synchronization layer to one of these\nstandard techniques. We also develop a generalization of expurgated PPM suited\nfor the modulation layer of the proposed self-synchronizing modulation scheme.\nThis generalized PPM can also be used as stand-alone error-correcting PPM with\na larger number of available symbols.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Jan 2013 14:51:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 5 May 2013 03:19:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-20", "authors_parsed": [["Fujiwara", "Yuichiro", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.3375", "submitter": "Karin Schnass", "authors": "Karin Schnass", "title": "On the Identifiability of Overcomplete Dictionaries via the Minimisation\n  Principle Underlying K-SVD", "comments": "36 pages (double spaced), 3 figures, equivalent to final accepted\n  version", "journal-ref": "Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis, Volume 37, Issue 3,\n  November 2014, Pages 464-491", "doi": "10.1016/j.acha.2014.01.005", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article gives theoretical insights into the performance of K-SVD, a\ndictionary learning algorithm that has gained significant popularity in\npractical applications.

For stronger deviations where the Edgeworth expansion\nbecomes unwieldy, we employ the saddle point method and asymptotic integration\ntools to establish new analytical characterizations which are shown to be very\nsimple and accurate. Based on these results we also recover key well\nestablished properties of the tail distribution, including the\ndiversity-multiplexing-tradeoff.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Jan 2013 23:02:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-26", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Shang", ""], ["McKay", "Matthew R.", ""], ["Chen", "Yang", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.5034", "submitter": "Harpreet S.

In this paper, we propose a new configuration of\nframe: Quasi-Equiangular Frame, as a compromise but more convenient and\nflexible approximation of ETF and Grassmannian Frame. We will give formal\ndefinition of Quasi-Equiangular Frame and analyze its relationship with ETF and\nGrassmannian frame.
