It is assumed that\nperfect channel side information (CSI) is available at both the transmitter and\nthe receivers. Initially, the scenario in which the transmitter sends common\nmessages to two receivers and confidential messages to one receiver is\nconsidered. For this case, effective secure throughput region, which is the\nregion of constant arrival rates of common and confidential messages that can\nbe supported by the buffer-constrained transmitter and fading broadcast\nchannel, is defined. It is proven that this effective throughput region is\nconvex. Then, the optimal power control policies that achieve the boundary\npoints of the effective secure throughput region are investigated and an\nalgorithm for the numerical computation of the optimal power adaptation schemes\nis provided. Subsequently, the special case in which the transmitter sends only\nconfidential messages to one receiver, is addressed in more detail. For this\ncase, effective secure throughput is formulated and two different power\nadaptation policies are studied. In particular, it is noted that opportunistic\ntransmission is no longer optimal under buffer constraints and the transmitter\nshould not wait to send the data at a high rate until the main channel is much\nbetter than the eavesdropper channel.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Nov 2010 21:05:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Qiao", "Deli", ""], ["Gursoy", "Mustafa Cenk", ""], ["Velipasalar", "Senem", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.0018", "submitter": "Jan Ostergaard", "authors": "Jan Ostergaard, Richard Heusdens, and Jesper Jensen", "title": "n-Channel Asymmetric Entropy-Constrained Multiple-Description Lattice\n  Vector Quantization", "comments": "49 pages, 4 figures.

We make a connection between compressive sensing and traditional\ninformation theoretic techniques in source coding and channel coding.

The key difference of compressive sensing and traditional\ninformation theoretic approaches is at their decoding side. Although optimal\ndecoders to recover the original signal, compressed by source coding have high\ncomplexity, the compressive sensing decoder is a linear or convex optimization.\nFirst, we investigate applications of compressive sensing on distributed\ncompression of correlated sources. Here, by using compressive sensing, we\npropose a compression scheme for a family of correlated sources with a\nmodularized decoder, providing a trade-off between the compression rate and the\ndecoding complexity. We call this scheme Sparse Distributed Compression. We use\nthis compression scheme for a general multicast network with correlated\nsources. Here, we first decode some of the sources by a network decoding\ntechnique and then, we use a compressive sensing decoder to obtain the whole\nsources. Then, we investigate applications of compressive sensing on channel\ncoding. We propose a coding scheme that combines compressive sensing and random\nchannel coding for a high-SNR point-to-point Gaussian channel. We call this\nscheme Sparse Channel Coding.

A novel paradigm, called\ncompressed neighbor discovery is proposed, which enables all nodes to\nsimultaneously discover their respective neighborhoods with a single frame of\ntransmission, which is typically of a few thousand symbol epochs. The key\ntechnique is to assign each node a unique on-off signature and let all nodes\nsimultaneously transmit their signatures. Despite that the radios are\nhalf-duplex, each node observes a superposition of its neighbors' signatures\n(partially) through its own off-slots. To identify its neighbors out of a large\nnetwork address space, each node solves a compressed sensing (or sparse\nrecovery) problem.\n  Two practical schemes are studied. The first employs random on-off\nsignatures, and each node discovers its neighbors using a noncoherent detection\nalgorithm based on group testing. The second scheme uses on-off signatures\nbased on a deterministic second-order Reed-Muller code, and applies a chirp\ndecoding algorithm. The second scheme needs much lower signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) to achieve the same error performance. The complexity of the chirp\ndecoding algorithm is sub-linear, so that it is in principle scalable to\nnetworks with billions of nodes with 48-bit IEEE 802.11 MAC addresses.

Different from traditional approaches, which directly utilize\n$\\ell_1$ norm to measure the sparseness, LHR introduces a more reasonable\nlog-sum measurement to enhance the sparsity in both the intrinsic low-rank\nstructure and in the sparse corruptions. Although the proposed LHR optimization\nis no longer convex, it still can be effectively solved by a\nmajorization-minimization (MM) type algorithm, with which the non-convex\nobjective function is iteratively replaced by its convex surrogate and LHR\nfinally falls into the general framework of reweighed approaches.

The deployment of this\ntechnique requires channel-state information (CSI) feedback from each receiver\nto all interferers, resulting in substantial network overhead. To address this\nissue, this paper proposes the method of distributive control that\nintelligently allocates CSI bits over multiple feedback links and adapts\nfeedback to channel dynamics. For symmetric channel distributions, it is\noptimal for each receiver to equally allocate the average sum-feedback rate for\ndifferent feedback links, thereby decoupling their control. Using the criterion\nof minimum sum-interference power, the optimal feedback-control policy is shown\nusing stochastic-optimization theory to exhibit opportunism. Specifically, a\nspecific feedback link is turned on only when the corresponding transmit-CSI\nerror is significant or interference-channel gain large, and the optimal number\nof feedback bits increases with this gain. For high mobility and considering\nthe sphere-cap-quantized-CSI model, the optimal feedback-control policy is\nshown to perform water-filling in time, where the number of feedback bits\nincreases logarithmically with the corresponding interference-channel gain.\nFurthermore, we consider asymmetric channel distributions with heterogeneous\npath losses and high mobility, and prove the existence of a unique optimal\npolicy for jointly controlling multiple feedback links.

The decoding problem is then the following one: the whole mother point\nprocess is known as well as the coordinates of some daughter point; the\ndisplacements are only known through their law; can one find the mother of this\ndaughter point? The Shannon regime is that where the dimension $n$ tends to\ninfinity and where the logarithm of the intensity of the point process is\nproportional to $n$. We show that this problem exhibits a sharp threshold: if\nthe sum of the proportionality factor and of the differential entropy rate of\nthe noise is positive, then the probability of finding the right mother point\ntends to 0 with $n$ for all point processes and decoding strategies. If this\nsum is negative, there exist mother point processes, for instance Poisson, and\ndecoding strategies, for instance maximum likelihood, for which the probability\nof finding the right mother tends to 1 with $n$.

The proposed analog & digital opportunistic feedback schemes are\nshown to achieve the same sum-rate throughput as that achieved by dedicated\nfeedback schemes, but with feedback channels growing only logarithmically with\nnumber of users. Moreover, there is also a reduction in the feedback load. In\nthe analog feedback case, we show that the proposed scheme reduces the feedback\nnoise which eventually results in better throughput, whereas in the digital\nfeedback case the proposed scheme in a noisy scenario achieves almost the\nthroughput obtained in a noiseless dedicated feedback scenario. We also show\nthat for a given fixed budget of feedback bits, there exists a trade-off\nbetween the number of shared channels and thresholds accuracy of the fed back\nSNR.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 25 Dec 2010 05:54:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 13 Feb 2015 21:50:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Qaseem", "Syed", ""], ["Al-Naffouri", "Tareq", ""], ["Eltayeb", "Mohammed", ""], ["Bahrami", "Hamid Reza", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.5464", "submitter": "Akihiro Munemasa", "authors": "Masaaki Harada and Akihiro Munemasa", "title": "Classification of self-dual codes of length 36", "comments": "10 pages, minor revision", "journal-ref": "Advances Math.
