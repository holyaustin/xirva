In the first part,\nthe linear-programming (LP) decoder for binary linear codes is extended to JD\nof binary-input FSCs. In particular, we provide a rigorous definition of LP\njoint-decoding pseudo-codewords (JD-PCWs) that enables evaluation of the\npairwise error probability between codewords and JD-PCWs in AWGN. This leads\nnaturally to a provable upper bound on decoder failure probability. If the\nchannel is a finite-state intersymbol interference channel, then the joint LP\ndecoder also has the maximum-likelihood (ML) certificate property and all\ninteger-valued solutions are codewords. In this case, the performance loss\nrelative to ML decoding can be explained completely by fractional-valued\nJD-PCWs. After deriving these results, we discovered some elements were\nequivalent to earlier work by Flanagan on LP receivers.\n  In the second part, we develop an efficient iterative solver for the joint LP\ndecoder discussed in the first part. In particular, we extend the approach of\niterative approximate LP decoding, proposed by Vontobel and Koetter and\nanalyzed by Burshtein, to this problem. By taking advantage of the dual-domain\nstructure of the JD-LP, we obtain a convergent iterative algorithm for joint LP\ndecoding whose structure is similar to BCJR-based turbo equalization (TE). The\nresult is a joint iterative decoder whose per-iteration complexity is similar\nto that of TE but whose performance is similar to that of joint LP decoding.\nThe main advantage of this decoder is that it appears to provide the\npredictability of joint LP decoding and superior performance with the\ncomputational complexity of TE. One expected application is coding for magnetic\nstorage where the required block-error rate is extremely low and system\nperformance is difficult to verify by simulation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Feb 2011 00:21:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 27 Jul 2011 19:49:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-27", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Byung-Hak", ""], ["Pfister", "Henry D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.1497", "submitter": "Kazushi Mimura", "authors": "Kazushi Mimura, Florent Cousseau, Masato Okada", "title": "Belief Propagation for Error Correcting Codes and Lossy Compression\n  Using Multilayer Perceptrons", "comments": "18 pages, 18 figures", "journal-ref": "J.

The most\nprominent of these problems include (a) the existence of network codes that\nachieve maximum rate of transmission, (b) efficient network code constructions,\nand (c) field size issues. In practice, however, networks have transmission\ndelays. In network coding theory, such networks with transmission delays are\ngenerally abstracted by assuming that their edges have integer delays. Note\nthat using enough memory at the nodes of an acyclic network with integer delays\ncan effectively simulate instantaneous behavior, which is probably why only\nacyclic instantaneous networks have been primarily focused on thus far. In this\nwork, we elaborate on issues ((a), (b) and (c) above) related to network coding\nfor acyclic networks with integer delays, which have till now mostly been\noverlooked.

In the original approach to RNLC intermediate nodes code together all\navailable information. This requires intermediate nodes to keep considerable\ndata available for coding. Moreover, it results in a coding complexity that\ngrows linearly with the size of this data. While this has been identified as a\nproblem, approaches that combine queuing theory and network coding have\nheretofore not provided a succinct representation of the memory needs of\nnetwork coding at intermediates nodes.\n  This paper shows the surprising result that, in all settings with a\ncontinuous stream of data, network coding continues to perform optimally even\nif only one packet per node is kept in active memory and used for computations.\nThis leads to an extremely simple RLNC protocol variant with drastically\nreduced requirements on computational and memory resources. By extending the\nprojection analysis, we show that in all settings in which the RLNC protocol\nwas proven to be optimal its finite memory variant performs equally well. In\nthe same way as the original projection analysis, our technique applies in a\nwide variety of network models, including highly dynamic topologies that can\nchange completely at any time in an adversarial fashion.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Feb 2011 23:07:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Haeupler", "Bernhard", ""], ["M\u00e9dard", "Muriel", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.3214", "submitter": "Ehsan Ardestanizadeh", "authors": "Ehsan Ardestanizadeh, Paolo Minero, Massimo Franceschetti", "title": "LQG Control Approach to Gaussian Broadcast Channels with Feedback", "comments": "Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A code for communication over the k-receiver additive white Gaussian noise\nbroadcast channel with feedback is presented and analyzed using tools from the\ntheory of linear quadratic Gaussian optimal control.

It is shown\nthat for the case of finite complex input constellations, the relay gain\nattains the maximum at a particular SNR and at higher SNRs the relay gain tends\nto become zero. Since practical schemes always use finite complex input\nconstellation, the above result means that the relay offers maximum advantage\nover the direct transmission when we operate at a particular SNR and offers no\nadvantage at very high SNRs. This is contrary to the results already known for\nthe relay channel with Gaussian input alphabet.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Feb 2011 16:27:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-22", "authors_parsed": [["Muralidharan", "Vijayvaradharaj T", ""], ["Rajan", "B.

Here, we consider binary 3D-TCs while the original work of Berrou et\nal. considered double-binary codes. In the first part of the paper, the minimum\ndistance properties are analyzed from an ensemble perspective, both in the\nfinite-length regime and in the asymptotic case of large block lengths. In\nparticular, we analyze the asymptotic weight distribution of 3D-TCs and show\nnumerically that their typical minimum distance dmin may, depending on the\nspecific parameters, asymptotically grow linearly with the block length, i.e.,\nthe 3D-TC ensemble is asymptotically good for some parameters. In the second\npart of the paper, we derive some useful upper bounds on the dmin when using\nquadratic permutation polynomial (QPP) interleavers with a quadratic inverse.\nFurthermore, we give examples of interleaver lengths where an upper bound\nappears to be tight. The best codes (in terms of estimated dmin) obtained by\nrandomly searching for good pairs of QPPs for use in the 3D-TC are compared to\na probabilistic lower bound on the dmin when selecting codes from the 3D-TC\nensemble uniformly at random. This comparison shows that the use of designed\nQPP interleavers can improve the dmin significantly. For instance, we have\nfound a (6144,2040) 3D-TC with an estimated dmin of 147, while the\nprobabilistic lower bound is 69. Higher rates are obtained by puncturing\nnonsystematic bits, and optimized periodic puncturing patterns for rates 1/2,\n2/3, and 4/5 are found by computer search.

As a result,\na receiver that is interested in one of these signals sees the others as\nunwanted interference. This property of the wireless medium is typically viewed\nas a hindrance to reliable communication over a network. However, using a\nrecently developed coding strategy, interference can in fact be harnessed for\nnetwork coding. In a wired network, (linear) network coding refers to each\nintermediate node taking its received packets, computing a linear combination\nover a finite field, and forwarding the outcome towards the destinations. Then,\ngiven an appropriate set of linear combinations, a destination can solve for\nits desired packets. For certain topologies, this strategy can attain\nsignificantly higher throughputs over routing-based strategies. Reliable\nphysical layer network coding takes this idea one step further: using\njudiciously chosen linear error-correcting codes, intermediate nodes in a\nwireless network can directly recover linear combinations of the packets from\nthe observed noisy superpositions of transmitted signals.
