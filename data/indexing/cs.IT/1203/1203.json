We exploit this by designing a linear coding\nstrategy for the case of layered discrete relay networks. The linear coding\nstrategy is near-optimal for Gaussian and discrete networks and achieves rates\nwithin O(M^2) bits of the capacity, independent of channel gains or SNR. The\nlinear code is robust and the relays need not know the channel gains. The\ntransmit and receive signals at all relays are simply quantized to binary\ntuples of the same length $n$ . The linear network code requires all the relay\nnodes to collect the received binary tuples into a long binary vector and apply\na linear transformation on the long vector. The resulting binary vector is\nsplit into smaller binary tuples for transmission by the relays. The\nquantization requirements of the linear network code are completely defined by\nthe parameter $n$, which also determines the resolution of the\nanalog-to-digital and digital-to-analog convertors for operating the network\nwithin a bounded gap of the network's capacity. The linear network code\nexplicitly connects network coding for wireline networks with codes for\nGaussian networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 11 Mar 2012 06:56:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Muralidhar", "Anand", ""], ["Kumar", "P.

A distinguishing feature of wireless sensors is the need to perform\nboth source coding tasks, such as measurement and compression, and transmission\ntasks. It is known that the overall energy consumption for source coding is\ngenerally comparable to that of transmission, and that a joint design of the\ntwo classes of tasks can lead to relevant performance gains. Moreover, the\nefficiency of source coding in a sensor network can be potentially improved via\ndistributed techniques by leveraging the fact that signals measured by\ndifferent nodes are correlated.\n  In this paper, a data gathering protocol for multihop wireless sensor\nnetworks with energy harvesting capabilities is studied whereby the sources\nmeasured by the sensors are correlated. Both the energy consumptions of source\ncoding and transmission are modeled, and distributed source coding is assumed.\nThe problem of dynamically and jointly optimizing the source coding and\ntransmission strategies is formulated for time-varying channels and sources.\nThe problem consists in the minimization of a cost function of the distortions\nin the source reconstructions at the sink under queue stability constraints. By\nadopting perturbation-based Lyapunov techniques, a close-to-optimal online\nscheme is proposed that has an explicit and controllable trade-off between\noptimality gap and queue sizes. The role of side information available at the\nsink is also discussed under the assumption that acquiring the side information\nentails an energy cost.
