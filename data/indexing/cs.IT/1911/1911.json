The\nclassical definition of LDP assumes that all elements in the data domain are\nequally sensitive. However, in many applications, some symbols are more\nsensitive than others. This work proposes a context-aware framework of local\ndifferential privacy that allows a privacy designer to incorporate the\napplication's context into the privacy definition. For binary data domains, we\nprovide a universally optimal privatization scheme and highlight its\nconnections to Warner's randomized response (RR) and Mangat's improved\nresponse. Motivated by geolocation and web search applications, for $k$-ary\ndata domains, we consider two special cases of context-aware LDP:\nblock-structured LDP and high-low LDP. We study discrete distribution\nestimation and provide communication-efficient, sample-optimal schemes and\ninformation-theoretic lower bounds for both models. We show that using\ncontextual information can require fewer samples than classical LDP to achieve\nthe same accuracy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Oct 2019 18:15:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 27 Jul 2020 23:00:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Acharya", "Jayadev", ""], ["Bonawitz", "Keith", ""], ["Kairouz", "Peter", ""], ["Ramage", "Daniel", ""], ["Sun", "Ziteng", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.00101", "submitter": "Vaibhav Kumar", "authors": "Vaibhav Kumar, Barry Cardiff, Shankar Prakriya, and Mark F.

The\nexperiments show that the proposed policy outperforms other state-of-the-art\nscheduling policies, with the best achievable model accuracy under training\ntime budgets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Nov 2019 09:37:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-05", "authors_parsed": [["Shi", "Wenqi", ""], ["Zhou", "Sheng", ""], ["Niu", "Zhisheng", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.00934", "submitter": "Jun Sun Dr.", "authors": "Jun Sun, Gang Wang, Georgios B.

Using the set of\ndetected active spreading sequences, an MMSE estimator is employed to produce\nlog-likelihood ratios (LLRs) for the second part of the messages corresponding\nto these detected users. The LLRs associated with each detected user are then\npassed to a list decoder of the polar code, which performs single-user decoding\nto decode the second portion of the message.

Specifically, the instantaneous AoI is below the bounded AoI\na large percentage of the time. We give a theoretical upper bound for bounded\nAoI. Our simulation results are consistent with our theoretical analysis.\nAlthough TDMA outperforms FDMA in terms of average AoI, FDMA is more robust\nagainst varying channel conditions since it gives a more stable bounded AoI\nacross different received powers.

The\npairwise (or bivariate) transfer entropy from a source to a target node in a\nnetwork does not depend solely on the local source-target link weight, but on\nthe wider network structure that the link is embedded in. This relationship is\nstudied using a discrete-time linearly-coupled Gaussian model, which allows us\nto derive the transfer entropy for each link from the network topology. It is\nshown analytically that the dependence on the directed link weight is only a\nfirst approximation, valid for weak coupling. More generally, the transfer\nentropy increases with the in-degree of the source and decreases with the\nin-degree of the target, indicating an asymmetry of information transfer\nbetween hubs and low-degree nodes.

Historically, system budgets have been described by the Q-factor\nconverted from the bit error rate (BER) under binary modulation and direct\ndetection. The introduction of hard-decision forward error correction (FEC) did\nnot change this. In recent years technologies have changed significantly to\ncomprise coherent detection, multilevel modulation and soft FEC. In such\nadvanced systems, different metrics such as (nomalized) generalized mutual\ninformation (GMI/NGMI) and asymmetric information (ASI) are regarded as being\nmore reliable. On the other hand, Q budgets are still useful because pre-FEC\nBER monitoring is established in industry for live system monitoring.\n  The pre-FEC BER is easily estimated from available information of the number\nof flipped bits in the FEC decoding, which does not require knowledge of the\ntransmitted bits that are unknown in live systems. Therefore, the use of\nmetrics like GMI/NGMI/ASI for performance monitoring has not been possible in\nlive systems. However, in this work we propose a blind soft-performance\nestimation method. Based on a histogram of log-likelihood-values without the\nknowledge of the transmitted bits, we show how the ASI can be estimated.\n  We examined the proposed method experimentally for 16 and 64-ary quadrature\namplitude modulation (QAM) and probabilistically shaped 16, 64, and 256-QAM in\nrecirculating loop experiments.

In SM, only one transmitter is active\nat any given time while the rest of them remain silent. The index of the active\ntransmitter carries information. This spatial information is in addition to the\ndata carried by the constellation symbols in the signal domain. Therefore, SM\nincreases the transmission rate of the communication system compared to\nsingle-input-single-output and space-time block coding (STBC)-MIMO. For signal\ndomain data encoding, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has\nbeen widely adopted. The key benefits in multi-carrier intensity-modulation and\ndirect-detection (IM/DD) systems are: i) the capability to achieve high\nspectral efficiency and ii) the ability to effectively mitigate direct-current\n(DC) wander effects and the impact of ambient light. However, current off-the\nshelf light emitting diodes (LEDs) which are used as transmit entities are\nprimarily bandwidth limited. Thus, there are benefits of combining SM and OFDM\nto enhance transmission speeds while maintaining low complexity. In this paper,\nthe two most common OFDM-based SM types, namely frequency domain SM (FD-SM) and\ntime domain SM (TD-SM), are investigated for optical wireless communications\n(OWC). Moreover, proof-ofconcept experimental results are presented to showcase\npractical feasibility of both techniques. The obtained results are also\ncompared with Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that TDSM with an\noptimal maximum-a-posteriori-probability (MAP) detector significantly\noutperforms FD-SM. It can be inferred from the results that TD SM is a strong\ncandidate among OFDM-based optical SM systems for future optical IM/DD wireless\ncommunication systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 23 Nov 2019 16:10:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Yesilkaya", "Anil", ""], ["Bian", "Rui", ""], ["Tavakkolnia", "Iman", ""], ["Haas", "Harald", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.10449", "submitter": "Parham Noorzad", "authors": "Parham Noorzad and Michael Langberg and Michelle Effros", "title": "Negligible Cooperation: Contrasting the Maximal- and Average-Error Cases", "comments": "30 pages, 1 figure.

We assume that the unknown eavesdropper\nlocation is within an ellipse characterizing the coverage region of the\ntransmitter. By sequentially optimizing the transmit power, the flight path of\nthe UAV and its jamming power, we aim at maximizing the average secrecy rate\nwith arbitrary eavesdropper location. Simulation results demonstrate that the\noptimal flight path obtains better secrecy rate performance compared to that\nusing direct UAV flight path encasing the transmitter and the legitimate\nreceiver. Most importantly, even with the unknown eavesdropper location, we\nobtained a secrecy rate that is comparable to a scenario when the\neavesdropper's location is known. However, the average secrecy rate with the\nunknown eavesdropper location varies depending on the proximity of the\neavesdropper to the known location of the transmitter. We also observe that due\nto the UAV-aided jamming, the average secrecy rate stabilizes at some point\neven though the average received envelope power of the eavesdropper increases.\nThis essentially demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Nov 2019 23:45:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-10", "authors_parsed": [["Nnamani", "Christantus O.", ""], ["Khandaker", "Muhammad R.

Reconstructing haplotypes of an\nindividual from short sequencing reads is an NP-hard problem that becomes even\nmore challenging in the case of polyploids. While increasing lengths of\nsequencing reads and insert sizes {\\color{black} helps improve accuracy of\nreconstruction}, it also exacerbates computational complexity of the haplotype\nassembly task. This has motivated the pursuit of algorithmic frameworks capable\nof accurate yet efficient assembly of haplotypes from high-throughput\nsequencing data.\n  Results: We propose a novel graphical representation of sequencing reads and\npose the haplotype assembly problem as an instance of community detection on a\nspatial random graph. To this end, we construct a graph where each read is a\nnode with an unknown community label associating the read with the haplotype it\nsamples. Haplotype reconstruction can then be thought of as a two-step\nprocedure: first, one recovers the community labels on the nodes (i.e., the\nreads), and then uses the estimated labels to assemble the haplotypes.

This paper is the first work to study the\nresource allocation for a secure mission-critical IoT communication system with\nURLLC. Specifically, we adopt the security capacity formula under finite\nblocklength and consider two optimization problems: weighted throughput\nmaximization problem and total transmit power minimization problem. Each\noptimization problem is non-convex and challenging to solve, and we develop\nefficient methods to solve each optimization problem. Simulation results\nconfirm the fast convergence speed of our proposed algorithm and demonstrate\nthe performance advantages over the existing benchmark algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Nov 2019 15:37:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 22:57:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-14", "authors_parsed": [["Ren", "Hong", ""], ["Pan", "Cunhua", ""], ["Deng", "Yansha", ""], ["Elkashlan", "Maged", ""], ["Nallanathan", "Arumugam", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.13172", "submitter": "Sergiy Vorobyov A.", "authors": "Mohammad Neinavaie and Mostafa~Derakhtian and Sergiy A.
