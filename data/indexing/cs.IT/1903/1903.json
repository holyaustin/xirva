Motivated by this necessity, we develop a resource theory for magic\nquantum channels to characterize and quantify the quantum \"magic\" or\nnon-stabilizerness of noisy quantum circuits. For qudit quantum computing with\nodd dimension $d$, it is known that quantum states with non-negative Wigner\nfunction can be efficiently simulated classically. First, inspired by this\nobservation, we introduce a resource theory based on completely\npositive-Wigner-preserving quantum operations as free operations, and we show\nthat they can be efficiently simulated via a classical algorithm. Second, we\nintroduce two efficiently computable magic measures for quantum channels,\ncalled the mana and thauma of a quantum channel. As applications, we show that\nthese measures not only provide fundamental limits on the distillable magic of\nquantum channels, but they also lead to lower bounds for the task of\nsynthesizing non-Clifford gates. Third, we propose a classical algorithm for\nsimulating noisy quantum circuits, whose sample complexity can be quantified by\nthe mana of a quantum channel. We further show that this algorithm can\noutperform another approach for simulating noisy quantum circuits, based on\nchannel robustness.

We consider two distinct design methodologies: I) the synthesis of\na `flat mainlobe' beam model which maximizes the minimum effective array gain\nover the beam misalignment range, and II) the inclusion of the `error\nstatistics' into the design, where the array response incorporating the\ndistribution of the misalignment error is derived. For both design\nmethodologies, we propose a hybrid precoding design that approximates the\nrobust fully-digital precoder, which is obtained via alternating optimization\nbased on the gradient projection (GP) method. We also propose a low-complexity\nalternative to the GP algorithm based on the least square projection (LSP), and\nwe further deploy a second-stage digital precoder to mitigate any residual\ninter-receiver interference after the hybrid analog-digital precoding.\nNumerical results show that the robust hybrid precoding designs can effectively\nalleviate the performance degradation incurred by beam misalignment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Mar 2019 01:34:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-25", "authors_parsed": [["Pradhan", "Chandan", ""], ["Li", "Ang", ""], ["Zhuo", "Li", ""], ["Li", "Yonghui", ""], ["Vucetic", "Branka", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.09299", "submitter": "Rania Morsi", "authors": "Rania Morsi, Vahid Jamali, Amelie Hagelauer, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng, and\n  Robert Schober", "title": "Conditional Capacity and Transmit Signal Design for SWIPT Systems with\n  Multiple Nonlinear Energy Harvesting Receivers", "comments": "32 pages, 10 figures, 2 Tables, accepted for publication IEEE\n  Transactions on Communications, DOI 10.1109/TCOMM.2019.2951109", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study information-theoretic limits for simultaneous wireless information\nand power transfer (SWIPT) systems employing nonlinear radio frequency (RF)\nenergy harvesting (EH) receivers (Rxs).

Owing to the nonlinearity of the EH Rxs'\ncircuitry, the efficiency of wireless power transfer depends on the waveform of\nthe transmitted signal. We aim to answer the following fundamental question:\nWhat is the optimal input distribution of the transmit signal waveform that\nmaximizes the information transfer rate at the ID Rx conditioned on individual\nminimum required direct-current (DC) powers to be harvested at the EH Rxs?\nSpecifically, we study the conditional capacity problem of a SWIPT system\nimpaired by additive white Gaussian noise subject to average-power (AP) and\npeak power (PP) constraints at the transmitter and nonlinear EH constraints at\nthe EH Rxs. To this end, we develop a novel nonlinear EH model that captures\nthe saturation of the harvested DC power by taking into account the reverse\nbreakdown current of the rectifying diode. We derive a novel semiclosed-form\nexpression for the harvested DC power, which simplifies to closed form for low\ninput RF powers.

To overcome the\nsampling rate bottleneck for wideband spectrum sensing, in this paper, we study\nthe problem of compressed power spectrum estimation whose objective is to\nreconstruct the power spectrum of a wide-sense stationary signal based on\nsub-Nyquist samples. By exploring the sampling structure inherent in the\nmulticoset sampling scheme, we develop a computationally efficient method for\npower spectrum reconstruction. An important advantage of our proposed method\nover existing compressed power spectrum estimation methods is that our proposed\nmethod, whose primary computational task consists of fast Fourier transform\n(FFT), has a very low computational complexity. Such a merit makes it possible\nto efficiently implement the proposed algorithm in a practical\nfield-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based system for real-time wideband\nspectrum sensing. Our proposed method also provides a new perspective on the\npower spectrum recovery condition, which leads to a result similar to what was\nreported in prior works. Simulation results are presented to show the\ncomputational efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Mar 2019 04:02:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 16 Oct 2019 03:29:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-17", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Linxiao", ""], ["Fang", "Jun", ""], ["Duan", "Huiping", ""], ["Li", "Hongbin", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.09931", "submitter": "Ali Nasir", "authors": "Ali A.

Copying occurs\nwhen messages are transmitted without modification, e.g., when an offspring\nreceives an unaltered copy of a gene from its parent. Transformation occurs\nwhen messages are modified systematically during transmission, e.g., when\nmutational biases occur during genetic replication. Standard\ninformation-theoretic measures do not distinguish these two modes of\ninformation transfer, although they may reflect different mechanisms and have\ndifferent functional consequences. Starting from a few simple axioms, we derive\na decomposition of mutual information into the information transmitted by\ncopying versus the information transmitted by transformation. We begin with a\ndecomposition that applies when the source and destination of the channel have\nthe same set of messages and a notion of message identity exists. We then\ngeneralize our decomposition to other kinds of channels, which can involve\ndifferent source and destination sets and broader notions of similarity. In\naddition, we show that copy information can be interpreted as the minimal work\nneeded by a physical copying process, which is relevant for understanding the\nphysics of replication. We use the proposed decomposition to explore a model of\namino acid substitution rates.

We formulate a new problem to optimize the sensor's online\ntransmission control policy for static and Markov fading channels, which\ndepends on both the current estimation quality of the remote estimator and the\ncurrent number of retransmissions of the sensor, so as to minimize the\nlong-term remote estimation mean squared error (MSE).

In particular, it is challenging to derive the condition in terms\nof the communication channel quality and the LTI system parameters, to ensure a\nbounded long-term estimation MSE. We derive an elegant sufficient condition of\nthe existence of a stationary and deterministic optimal policy that stabilizes\nthe remote estimation system and minimizes the MSE.
