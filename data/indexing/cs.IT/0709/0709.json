Most of these papers assume\nperfect/imperfect channel knowledge. In general, the problem of channel\ntraining and estimation is studied separately. However, in interference-limited\ncommunication systems with high mobility, this problem is tightly coupled with\nthe problem of maximizing throughput of the system. In this paper, scheduling\nand pre-conditioning based schemes in the presence of reciprocal channel are\nconsidered to address this. In the case of homogeneous users, a scheduling\nscheme is proposed and an improved lower bound on the sum capacity is derived.\nThe problem of choosing training sequence length to maximize net throughput of\nthe system is studied. In the case of heterogeneous users, a modified\npre-conditioning method is proposed and an optimized pre-conditioning matrix is\nderived. This method is combined with a scheduling scheme to further improve\nnet achievable weighted-sum rate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Sep 2007 01:32:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 May 2008 18:55:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-05-05", "authors_parsed": [["Jose", "Jubin", ""], ["Ashikhmin", "Alexei", ""], ["Whiting", "Phil", ""], ["Vishwanath", "Sriram", ""]]}, {"id": "0709.4671", "submitter": "Ruoheng Liu", "authors": "Ruoheng Liu and H.

Security and privacy systems have\nbecome critical for wireless providers and enterprise networks. This paper\nconsiders the problem of secret communication over the Gaussian broadcast\nchannel, where a multi-antenna transmitter sends independent confidential\nmessages to two users with information-theoretic secrecy. That is, each user\nwould like to obtain its own confidential message in a reliable and safe\nmanner. This communication model is referred to as the multi-antenna Gaussian\nbroadcast channel with confidential messages (MGBC-CM). Under this\ncommunication scenario, a secret dirty-paper coding scheme and the\ncorresponding achievable secrecy rate region are first developed based on\nGaussian codebooks. Next, a computable Sato-type outer bound on the secrecy\ncapacity region is provided for the MGBC-CM. Furthermore, the Sato-type outer\nbound prove to be consistent with the boundary of the secret dirty-paper coding\nachievable rate region, and hence, the secrecy capacity region of the MGBC-CM\nis established. Finally, two numerical examples demonstrate that both users can\nachieve positive rates simultaneously under the information-theoretic secrecy\nrequirement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Sep 2007 19:10:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Ruoheng", ""], ["Poor", "H.
