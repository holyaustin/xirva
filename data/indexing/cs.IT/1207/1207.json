The two transmitters jointly\ntransmit a common message to the two receivers, and transmitter 2 also sends a\nseparate message to receiver 2. The channel is corrupted by an independent and\nidentically distributed (i.i.d.) state sequence. The scenario in which the\nstate sequence is noncausally known only at transmitter 2 is first studied. For\nthe discrete memoryless channel and its degraded version, inner and outer\nbounds on the capacity region are obtained. The capacity region is\ncharacterized for the degraded semideterministic channel and channels that\nsatisfy a less noisy condition. The Gaussian channels are further studied,\nwhich are partitioned into two cases based on how the interference compares\nwith the signal at receiver 1. For each case, inner and outer bounds on the\ncapacity region are derived, and partial boundary of the capacity region is\ncharacterized. The full capacity region is characterized for channels that\nsatisfy certain conditions. The second scenario in which the state sequence is\nnoncausally known at both transmitter 2 and receiver 2 is further studied. The\ncapacity region is obtained for both the discrete memoryless and Gaussian\nchannels.

In\nthis work, the average capacity of SU with subcarrier collisions is employed as\nperformance measure to investigate the proposed random allocation scheme for\nboth general and Rayleigh channel fading models. Bounds and scaling laws of\naverage capacity with respect to the number of SU's, PUs' and available\nsubcarriers are derived. In addition, in the presence of multiple SUs, the\nmultiuser diversity gain of SUs assuming an opportunistic scheduling is also\ninvestigated. To avoid the interference at the SUs that might be caused by the\nrandom allocation scheme and obtain the maximum sum rate for SUs based on the\navailable subcarriers, an efficient centralized sequential algorithm based on\nthe opportunistic scheduling and random allocation (utilization) methods is\nproposed to ensure the orthogonality of assigned subcarriers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Jul 2012 19:43:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Ekin", "Sabit", ""], ["Abdallah", "Mohamed M.", ""], ["Qaraqe", "Khalid A.", ""], ["Serpedin", "Erchin", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.0543", "submitter": "Omar Fawzi", "authors": "Omar Fawzi and Ivan Savov", "title": "Rate-splitting in the presence of multiple receivers", "comments": "3 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the presence of multiple senders, one of the simplest decoding strategies\nthat can be employed by a receiver is successive decoding.

The SHO-FA algorithm is the first to\nsimultaneously have the following properties: (a) it requires only O(k)\nmeasurements, (b) the bit-precision of each measurement and each arithmetic\noperation is O (log(n) + P) (here 2^{-P} is the desired relative error in the\nreconstruction of x), (c) the decoding complexity is O(k) arithmetic operations\nand encoding complexity is O(n) arithmetic operations, and (d) if the\nreconstruction goal is simply to recover a single component of x instead of all\nof x, with significant probability over A this can be done in constant time.\nAll constants above are independent of all problem parameters other than the\ndesired success probability.

For these channels, special cases are\npresented where our outer bounds are tight, which yield the exact capacity.\nMore importantly, by using the derived outer bounds, a strong interference\nregime is identified for the general two-receiver interference networks with\nany arbitrary topology. This strong interference regime, which is represented\nby only two conditions, includes all previously known results for simple\ntopologies such as the two-user CIC, the cognitive radio channel, and many\nothers. Then, networks with arbitrary number of receivers are considered.\nFinding non-trivial strong interference regime for such networks, specifically\nfor the CICs with more than two users, has been one of the open problems in\nnetwork information theory. In this paper, we will give a solution to this\nproblem. Specifically, a new approach is developed based on which one can\nobtain strong interference regimes not only for the multi-user CICs but also\nfor any interference network of arbitrary large sizes. For this development,\nsome new technical lemmas are proved which have a central role in the\nderivations. As a result, this paper establishes the first non-trivial capacity\nresult for the multi-user classical interference channel. A general formula is\nalso presented to derive strong interference conditions for any given network\ntopology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Jul 2012 17:51:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 15 Feb 2013 06:50:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Farsani", "Reza K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.3040", "submitter": "Reza Khosravi-Farsani", "authors": "Reza K.

It is assumed that the system uses\na capacity-approaching code (e.g., turbo or LDPC) and noncoherent binary\ncontinuous-phase frequency-shift keying (CPFSK) modulation. By using\ntransmission capacity as the performance metric, the number of hopping\nchannels, CPFSK modulation index, and code rate are jointly optimized. Mobiles\nin the network are assumed to be uniformly located within a finite area.\nClosed-form expressions for outage probability are given for a network\ncharacterized by a physical interference channel. The outage probability is\nfirst found conditioned on the locations of the mobiles, and then averaged over\nthe spatial distribution of the mobiles. The transmission capacity, which is a\nmeasure of the spatial spectral efficiency, is obtained from the outage\nprobability. The transmission capacity is modified to account for the\nconstraints of the CPFSK modulation and capacity-approaching coding. Two\noptimization methods are proposed for maximizing the transmission capacity. The\nfirst is a brute-force method and the second is a gradient-search algorithm.\nThe results obtained from the optimization shed new insight into the\nfundamental tradeoffs among the number of frequency-hopping channels, the\nmodulation index, and the rate of the error-correcting code.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 14 Jul 2012 19:19:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-17", "authors_parsed": [["Talarico", "Salvatore", ""], ["Valenti", "Matthew C.", ""], ["Torrieri", "Don", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.3513", "submitter": "Amin Gohari", "authors": "Amin Gohari, Mohammad Hossein Yassaee and Mohammad Reza Aref", "title": "Secure Channel Simulation", "comments": "Short version to appear at ITW 2012.

For a class of environments that\nincludes many resource allocation games in communication networks, we provide\ntools for the manager to design an efficient system. In addition to reports and\nrecommendations, the design we employ allows the manager to intervene in the\nsystem after the users take actions. In an abstracted environment, we find\nconditions under which the manager can achieve the same outcome it could if\nusers were compliant, and conditions under which it does not. We then apply our\nframework and results to design a flow control management system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Jul 2012 16:12:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-18", "authors_parsed": [["Canzian", "Luca", ""], ["Xiao", "Yuanzhang", ""], ["Zame", "William", ""], ["Zorzi", "Michele", ""], ["van der Schaar", "Mihaela", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.4083", "submitter": "Matthew Valenti", "authors": "Matthew C.

In this model, mobiles and PBs fix their transmission power\nat p and q, respectively; a PB either radiates isotropically, called isotropic\nMPT, or directs energy towards target mobiles by beamforming, called directed\nMPT. The model is applied to derive the tradeoffs between the network\nparameters including p, q, and the BS/PB densities under the outage constraint.\nFirst, consider the deployment of the cellular network.

However, traditional linear estimation methods have two mainly\ndisadvantages: 1) demand of the high-speed ADC sampling rate which already\nexceeds the capability of current ADC and also the high-speed ADC is very\nexpensive for regular wireless communications; 2) neglect the inherent channel\nsparsity and the low spectral efficiency wireless communication is unavoidable.\nTo solve these challenges, in this paper, we propose a high-resolution\ncompressive channel estimation method by using low-speed ADC sampling.
