In\nthe main text, mathematical modelization helps for visualizing how policies\ncould e.g. influence the individual and collective behavior in an empirical\nsocial agent system. In order to show how this purpose could be achieved, two\napproaches, (i) the Ising model and (ii) a generalized Lotka-Volterra model are\nused for DD and IG considerations respectively. It can be concluded that the\nsocial modelization of the e-Information Society as a complex system provides\ninsights about how DD can be reduced and how the a large number of weak members\nof the IS could influence the outcomes of the IG.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 7 Jan 2012 11:39:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Olivera", "Noemi L.", "", "La Plata"], ["Proto", "Araceli N.", "", "Buenos Aires"], ["Ausloos", "Marcel", "", "Liege"]]}, {"id": "1201.1588", "submitter": "Chong Li", "authors": "Chong Li and Nicola Elia", "title": "Upper Bound on the Capacity of Gaussian Channels with Noisy Feedback", "comments": "6 pages.

In this\npaper, we aim at answering whether or not having a memory unit in the middle\ncan result in a fundamental gain in the universal compression. We present the\nproblem setup in the most basic scenario consisting of a server node $S$, a\nrelay node $R$ (i.e., the memory unit), and a client node $C$. We assume that\nserver $S$ wishes to send the sequence $x^n$ to the client $C$ who has never\nhad any prior communication with the server, and hence, is not capable of\nmemorization of the source context. However, $R$ has previously communicated\nwith $S$ to forward previous sequences from $S$ to the clients other than $C$,\nand thus, $R$ has memorized a context $y^m$ shared with $S$. Note that if the\nrelay node was absent the source could possibly apply universal compression to\n$x^n$ and transmit to $C$ whereas the presence of memorized context at $R$ can\npossibly reduce the communication overhead in $S$-$R$ link. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the fundamental gain of the context memorization in the\nmemory-assisted universal compression of the sequence $x^n$ over conventional\nuniversal source coding by providing a lower bound on the gain of\nmemory-assisted source coding.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Jan 2012 22:29:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Beirami", "Ahmad", ""], ["Fekri", "Faramarz", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.2201", "submitter": "Ahmad Beirami", "authors": "Ahmad Beirami and Hamid Nejati and Yehia Massoud", "title": "A Performance Metric for Discrete-Time Chaos-Based Truly Random Number\n  Generators", "comments": "MWSCAS08", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.DS math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we develop an information entropy based metric that represents\nthe statistical quality of the generated binary sequence in Truly Random Number\nGenerators (TRNG).

To attain\nthis, we form another MISOSE channel for upper-bounding, and tighten the bound\nby finding the worst correlations between the legitimate and eavesdropper\nchannel coefficients. The resulting upper bound is tighter than the others in\nthe literature which are based on modifying the correlation between the noises\nat the legitimate receiver and eavesdropper. Next, we fully characterize the\nergodic secrecy capacity by showing that the optimal channel input covariance\nmatrix is a scaled identity matrix, with the transmit power allocated uniformly\namong the antennas. The key to solve such a complicated stochastic optimization\nproblem is by exploiting the completely monotone property of the ergodic\nsecrecy capacity to use the stochastic ordering theory. Finally, our simulation\nresults show that for the considered channel setting, the secrecy capacity is\nbounded in both the high signal-to-noise ratio and large number of transmit\nantenna regimes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 13 Jan 2012 15:41:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Lin", "Shih-Chun", ""], ["Lin", "Pin-Hsun", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.2906", "submitter": "Mark Wilde", "authors": "Mark M.

First, since the SUs are\ndecentralized, they are selfish and aim to maximize their own long-term payoffs\nfrom utilizing the network rather than obeying the prescribed allocation of a\ncentralized controller. Second, the SUs interact with each other repeatedly and\nthey can coexist in the system for a long time. Third, the SUs have limited and\nimperfect monitoring ability: they only observe whether the IT constraints are\nviolated, and their observation is imperfect due to the erroneous measurements.\nTo capture these features, we model the interaction of the SUs as a repeated\ngame with imperfect monitoring. We first characterize the set of Pareto optimal\npayoffs that can be achieved by deviation-proof spectrum sharing policies,\nwhich are policies that the selfish users find it in their interest to comply\nwith.

Although the presented formula is usually difficult to\ncompute, it provides us useful insights into the interference channels. For\nexample, the formula suggests us that the simplest inner bounds (obtained by\ntreating the interference as noise) could be improved by taking into account\nthe structure of the interference processes. This is verified numerically by\ncomputing the mutual information rates for Gaussian interference channels with\nembedded convolutional codes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jan 2012 08:23:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 Feb 2012 13:00:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Lin", "Lei", ""], ["Ma", "Xiao", ""], ["Huang", "Xiujie", ""], ["Bai", "Baoming", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.6468", "submitter": "Shun Watanabe", "authors": "Shun Watanabe and Yasutada Oohama", "title": "Broadcast Channels with Confidential Messages by Randomness Constrained\n  Stochastic Encoder", "comments": "13 pages, 3 figures, In v2, references and a numerical example are\n  added.
