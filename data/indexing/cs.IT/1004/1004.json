In particular, MUDiv allows for scheduling among users in order to\neliminate the negative effects of unfavorable channel fading conditions of some\nusers on the system performance. Scheduling, however, consumes energy (e.g.,\nfor making users' channel state information available to the scheduler). This\nextra usage of energy, which could potentially be used for data transmission,\ncan be very wasteful, especially if the number of users is large. In this\npaper, we answer the question of how much MUDiv is required for energy limited\nMU systems. Focusing on uplink MU wireless systems, we develop MU scheduling\nalgorithms which aim at maximizing the MUDiv gain. Toward this end, we\nintroduce a new realistic energy model which accounts for scheduling energy and\ndescribes the distribution of the total energy between scheduling and data\ntransmission stages. Using the fact that such energy distribution can be\ncontrolled by varying the number of active users, we optimize this number by\neither (i) minimizing the overall system bit error rate (BER) for a fixed total\nenergy of all users in the system or (ii) minimizing the total energy of all\nusers for fixed BER requirements. We find that for a fixed number of available\nusers, the achievable MUDiv gain can be improved by activating only a subset of\nusers.

The two scenarios for which separation is optimal complement each\nother: the first is when the memoryless sources at source nodes are arbitrarily\ncorrelated, each of which is to be reconstructed at possibly multiple\ndestinations within certain distortions, but the channels in this network are\nsynchronized, orthogonal and memoryless point-to-point channels; the second is\nwhen the memoryless sources are mutually independent, each of which is to be\nreconstructed only at one destination within a certain distortion, but the\nchannels are general, including multi-user channels such as multiple access,\nbroadcast, interference and relay channels, possibly with feedback. The third\nscenario, for which we demonstrate approximate optimality of source-channel\nseparation, generalizes the second scenario by allowing each source to be\nreconstructed at multiple destinations with different distortions. For this\ncase, the loss from optimality by using the separation approach can be\nupper-bounded when a \"difference\" distortion measure is taken, and in the\nspecial case of quadratic distortion measure, this leads to universal constant\nbounds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Apr 2010 15:05:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 19 Nov 2010 17:02:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 3 Dec 2013 20:13:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Tian", "Chao", "", "Shitz"], ["Chen", "Jun", "", "Shitz"], ["Diggavi", "Suhas", "", "Shitz"], ["Shamai", "Shlomo", "", "Shitz"]]}, {"id": "1004.2683", "submitter": "Sergey Loyka", "authors": "Sergey Loyka, Francois Gagnon, Victoria Kostina", "title": "Error Rates of Capacity-Achieving Codes Are Convex", "comments": "accepted by ISIT-10", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Motivated by a wide-spread use of convex optimization techniques, convexity\nproperties of bit error rate of the maximum likelihood detector operating in\nthe AWGN channel are studied for arbitrary constellations and bit mappings,\nwhich also includes coding under maximum-likelihood decoding.
