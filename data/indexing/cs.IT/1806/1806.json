Low-rank matrices have\nalso received considerable attention recently in the context of optimization\nalgorithms with partial observations, and nuclear norm minimization (NNM) has\nbeen widely used as a popular heuristic of rank minimization for low-rank\nmatrix recovery problems. On the other hand, it has been shown that NNM can be\nviewed as a special case of atomic norm minimization (ANM), which has achieved\ngreat success in solving line spectrum estimation problems. However, as far as\nwe know, the general ANM (not NNM) considered in many existing works can only\nhandle frequency estimation in undamped sinusoids. In this work, we aim to fill\nthis gap and deal with damped spectrally sparse signal recovery problems. In\nparticular, inspired by the dual analysis used in ANM, we offer a novel\noptimization-based perspective on the classical MUSIC algorithm and propose an\nalgorithm for spectral estimation that involves searching for the peaks of the\ndual polynomial corresponding to a certain NNM problem, and we show that this\nalgorithm is in fact equivalent to MUSIC itself. Building on this connection,\nwe also extend the classical MUSIC algorithm to the missing data case. We\nprovide exact recovery guarantees for our proposed algorithms and quantify how\nthe sample complexity depends on the true spectral parameters. In particular,\nwe provide a parameter-specific recovery bound for low-rank matrix recovery of\njointly sparse signals rather than use certain incoherence properties as in\nexisting literature.

To\nefficiently manage the multi-dimensional heterogeneous resources, a\nservice-oriented network slicing approach is introduced, where the AGIVEN is\nvirtually divided into multiple slices and each slice supports a specific\napplication with guaranteed quality of service (QoS). Specifically, the\nfundamental problem of multi-resource provisioning in AGIVEN slicing is\ninvestigated, by taking into account typical vehicular applications of\nlocation-based map and popularity-based content services. For the\nlocation-based map service, the capability of HAP-vehicle proactive pushing is\nderived with respect to the HAP broadcast rate and vehicle cache size, wherein\na saddle point exists indicating the optimal communication-cache resource\ntrading. For the popular contents of common interests, the average on-board\ncontent hit ratio is obtained, with HAPs pushing newly generated contents to\nkeep on-board cache fresh. Then, the minimal RSU transmission rate is derived\nto meet the average delay requirements of each slice. The obtained analytical\nresults reveal the service-dependent resource provisioning and trading\nrelationships among RSU transmission rate, HAP broadcast rate, and vehicle\ncache size, which provides guidelines for multi-resource network slicing in\npractice.

A beam splitting technique is designed to generate multiple analog\nbeams to serve multiple users for NOMA transmission. Compared to conventional\nmmWave orthogonal multiple access (mmWave-OMA) schemes, the proposed scheme can\nserve more than one user on each radio frequency (RF) chain. Besides, in\ncontrast to the recently proposed single-beam mmWave-NOMA scheme which can only\nserve multiple NOMA users within the same beam, the proposed scheme can perform\nNOMA transmission for the users with an arbitrary angle-of-departure (AOD)\ndistribution. This provides a higher flexibility for applying NOMA in mmWave\ncommunications and thus can efficiently exploit the potential multi-user\ndiversity. Then, we design a suboptimal two-stage resource allocation for\nmaximizing the system sum-rate. In the first stage, assuming that only analog\nbeamforming is available, a user grouping and antenna allocation algorithm is\nproposed to maximize the conditional system sum-rate based on the coalition\nformation game theory. In the second stage, with the zero-forcing (ZF) digital\nprecoder, a suboptimal solution is devised to solve a non-convex power\nallocation optimization problem for the maximization of the system sum-rate\nwhich takes into account the quality of service (QoS) constraint. Simulation\nresults show that our designed resource allocation can achieve a\nclose-to-optimal performance in each stage.

Towards this\ndirection, full-duplex (FD) technology, being able to boost the spectral\nefficiency by transmitting and receiving simultaneously on the same frequency\nand time resources, is envisaged to play a key role in future networks.\nHowever, its benefits come at the expense of self-interference (SI) from their\nown transmit signal.

Next, we\ntackle the detrimental effect of SI in FD. In particular, and most importantly,\nnot only FD outperforms HD, but also RS enables increasing the range of SI over\nwhich FD outperforms HD. Furthermore, increasing the number of relay station\nantennas, RS appears to be more efficacious due to imperfect CSIT, since SI\ndecreases.

Due to the characteristics of the 5G application\nscenarios, channel estimation techniques have been tested in Orthogonal\nFrequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Generalized Frequency Division\nMultiplexing (GFDM) systems. The orthogonality between subcarriers in OFDM\nsystems permits inserting and extracting pilots without interference. However,\ndue to pulse shaping, subcarriers in GFDM are no longer orthogonal and\ninterfere with each other. Due to such interference, the channel estimation for\nGFDM is not trivial. A robust and low-complexity channel estimator can be\nobtained by combining a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) regularization and the\nbasis expansion model (BEM) approach. In this work, we develop a BEM-type\nchannel estimator along with a strategy to obtain the covariance matrix of the\nBEM coefficients.

The sensor is equipped with a battery of finite size\nto save its incoming energy, and consumes one unit of energy per status update\ntransmission, which is delivered to the destination instantly over an\nerror-free channel. The setting is online in which the harvested energy is\nrevealed to the sensor causally over time, and the goal is to design status\nupdate transmission policy such that the long term average age of information\n(AoI) is minimized. AoI is defined as the time elapsed since the latest update\nhas reached at the destination. Two energy arrival models are considered: a\nrandom battery recharge (RBR) model, and an incremental battery recharge (IBR)\nmodel. In both models, energy arrives according to a Poisson process with unit\nrate, with values that completely fill up the battery in the RBR model, and\nwith values that fill up the battery incrementally, unit-by-unit, in the IBR\nmodel. The key approach to characterizing the optimal status update policy for\nboth models is showing the optimality of renewal policies, in which the\ninter-update times follow a specific renewal process that depends on the energy\narrival model and the battery size. It is then shown that the optimal renewal\npolicy has an energy-dependent threshold structure, in which the sensor sends a\nstatus update only if the AoI grows above a certain threshold that depends on\nthe energy available. For both the RBR and the IBR models, the optimal\nenergy-dependent thresholds are characterized explicitly, i.e., in closed-form,\nin terms of the optimal long term average AoI. It is also shown that the\noptimal thresholds are monotonically decreasing in the energy available in the\nbattery, and that the smallest threshold, which comes in effect when the\nbattery is full, is equal to the optimal long term average AoI.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Jun 2018 17:50:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 9 May 2019 15:05:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-10", "authors_parsed": [["Arafa", "Ahmed", ""], ["Yang", "Jing", ""], ["Ulukus", "Sennur", ""], ["Poor", "H.

Another manifestation of this bottleneck is the lack of\nso-called simultaneous smoothing theorems for quantum states.\n  In this paper, we overcome the bottleneck by proving for the first time a\none-shot quantum joint typicality lemma with robust union and intersection\nproperties. To do so, we develop two novel tools in quantum information theory\nwhich may be of independent interest. The first tool is a simple geometric idea\ncalled tilting, which increases the angles between a family of subspaces in\northogonal directions. The second tool, called smoothing and augmentation, is a\nway of perturbing a multipartite quantum state such that the partial trace over\nany subset of registers does not increase the operator norm by much.\n  Our joint typicality lemma allows us to construct simultaneous quantum\ndecoders for many multiterminal quantum channels. It provides a powerful tool\nto extend many results in classical network information theory to the one-shot\nquantum setting.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Jun 2018 14:24:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 4 Jan 2019 07:47:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 24 Dec 2020 16:57:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-25", "authors_parsed": [["Sen", "Pranab", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.07333", "submitter": "Parisa Hassanzadeh", "authors": "Parisa Hassanzadeh, Antonia M.

A class of achievable correlation-aware\nschemes based on a two-step source coding approach is proposed. Library files\nare first compressed, and then cached and delivered using a combination of\ncorrelation-unaware multiple-request cache-aided coded multicast schemes. The\nfirst step uses Gray-Wyner source coding to represent the library via private\ndescriptions and descriptions that are common to more than one file. The second\nstep then becomes a multiple-request caching problem, where the demand\nstructure is dictated by the configuration of the compressed library, and it is\ninteresting in its own right. The performance of the proposed two-step scheme\nis evaluated by comparing its achievable rate with a lower bound on the optimal\npeak and average rate-memory tradeoffs in a two-file multiple-receiver network,\nand in a three-file two-receiver network. Specifically, in a network with two\nfiles and two receivers, the achievable rate matches the lower bound for a\nsignificant memory regime and it is within half of the conditional entropy of\nfiles for all other memory values.

The cloud is responsible for coordinating multiple Remote Radio\nHeads (RRHs) and scheduling users to their radio resources blocks (RRBs). The\ntransmit frame of each RRH consists of several orthogonal RRBs each maintained\nat a certain power level (PL). While previous works considered a vanilla\nversion in which each RRB can serve a single user, this paper proposes mixing\nthe flows of multiple users using instantly decodable network coding (IDNC).

Moreover, the\nselection of the different factor graph permutations is at random, which\nprevents the decoder to achieve a desirable error-correction performance with a\nsmall number of permutations. In this paper, we first show that the\npermutations on the factor graph can be mapped into suitable permutations on\nthe codeword positions. As a result, we can make use of a single decoder for\nall the permutations. In addition, we introduce a method to construct a set of\npredetermined permutations which can provide the correct codeword if the\ndecoding fails on the original permutation. We show that for the 5G polar code\nof length $1024$, the error-correction performance of the proposed decoder is\nmore than $0.25$ dB better than that of the BP decoder with the same number of\nrandom permutations at the frame error rate of $10^{-4}$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jun 2018 21:12:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Doan", "Nghia", ""], ["Hashemi", "Seyyed Ali", ""], ["Mondelli", "Marco", ""], ["Gross", "Warren J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.11250", "submitter": "Meng Hua", "authors": "Meng Hua, Yi Wang, Qingqing Wu, Chunguo Li, Yongming Huang, Luxi Yang", "title": "Energy Optimization for Cellular-Connected Multi-UAV Mobile Edge\n  Computing Systems with Multi-Access Schemes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, a cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) mobile\nedge computing system is studied in which the multiple UAVs are served by\nterrestrial base station (TBS) for computation task offloading.

For a good error-correcting\nperformance, list successive-cancellation decoding (LSCD) with large list size\nis used to decode polar codes. However, as the complexity and delay of the list\nmanagement operation rapidly increase with the list size, the overall latency\nof LSCD becomes large and limits the applicability of polar codes in\nhigh-throughput and latency-sensitive applications. Therefore, in this work,\nthe low-latency implementation for LSCD with large list size is studied.\nSpecifically, at the system level, a selective expansion method is proposed\nsuch that some of the reliable bits are not expanded to reduce the computation\nand latency. At the algorithmic level, a double thresholding scheme is proposed\nas a fast approximate-sorting method for the list management operation to\nreduce the LSCD latency for large list size. A VLSI architecture of the LSCD\nimplementing the selective expansion and double thresholding scheme is then\ndeveloped, and implemented using a UMC 90 nm CMOS technology.
