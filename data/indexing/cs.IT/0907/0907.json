Simply put, DOS involves a process of joint channel probing\nand distributed scheduling for ad-hoc (peer-to-peer) communications. Since, in\npractice, link conditions are estimated with noisy observations, the\ntransmission rate has to be backed off from the estimated rate to avoid\ntransmission outages. Then, a natural question to ask is whether it is\nworthwhile for the link with successful contention to perform further channel\nprobing to mitigate estimation errors, at the cost of additional probing. Thus\nmotivated, this work investigates DOS with two-level channel probing by\noptimizing the tradeoff between the throughput gain from more accurate rate\nestimation and the resulting additional delay. Capitalizing on optimal stopping\ntheory with incomplete information, we show that the optimal scheduling policy\nis threshold-based and is characterized by either one or two thresholds,\ndepending on network settings. Necessary and sufficient conditions for both\ncases are rigorously established. In particular, our analysis reveals that\nperforming second-level channel probing is optimal when the first-level\nestimated channel condition falls in between the two thresholds.

Fast iterative thresholding\nalgorithms have been intensively studied as alternatives to convex optimization\nfor large-scale problems. Unfortunately known fast algorithms offer\nsubstantially worse sparsity-undersampling tradeoffs than convex optimization.\n  We introduce a simple costless modification to iterative thresholding making\nthe sparsity-undersampling tradeoff of the new algorithms equivalent to that of\nthe corresponding convex optimization procedures. The new\niterative-thresholding algorithms are inspired by belief propagation in\ngraphical models.

In particular, the problem of finding the linear\nnetwork coding capacity region is equivalent to the characterization of all\nrepresentable, entropic polymatroids. In this paper, we describe a new approach\nto adhere two polymatroids together to produce a new polymatroid. Using this\napproach, we can construct a polymatroid that is not inside the minimal closed\nand convex cone containing all representable polymatroids. This polymatroid is\nproved to satisfy not only the Ingleton inequalities, but also the recently\nreported inequalities of Dougherty, Freiling and Zeger. A direct consequence is\nthat these inequalities are not sufficient to characterize representable\npolymatroids.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Jul 2009 05:06:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 19 Sep 2009 00:50:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-21", "authors_parsed": [["Chan", "Terence", ""], ["Grant", "Alex", ""], ["Kern", "Doris", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.5063", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Hermann Gruber, Markus Holzer, Martin Kutrib", "title": "On Measuring Non-Recursive Trade-Offs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "EPTCS 3, 2009, pp. 141-150", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.3.13", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We investigate the phenomenon of non-recursive trade-offs between\ndescriptional systems in an abstract fashion.

For Gaussian channels with secrecy constraints, however, efforts to\ndate rely on random codes. In this work, we advocate that structured codes are\nuseful for providing secrecy, and show how to compute the secrecy rate when\nstructured codes are used. In particular, we solve the problem of bounding\nequivocation rates with one important class of structured codes, i.e., nested\nlattice codes. Having established this result, we next demonstrate the use of\nstructured codes for secrecy in two-user Gaussian channels. In particular, with\nstructured codes, we prove that a positive secure degree of freedom is\nachievable for a large class of fully connected Gaussian channels as long as\nthe channel is not degraded. By way of this, for these channels, we establish\nthat structured codes outperform Gaussian random codes at high SNR. This class\nof channels include the two-user multiple access wiretap channel, the two-user\ninterference channel with confidential messages and the two-user interference\nwiretap channel. A notable consequence of this result is that, unlike the case\nwith Gaussian random codes, using structured codes for both transmission and\ncooperative jamming, it is possible to achieve an arbitrary large secrecy rate\ngiven enough power.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jul 2009 18:28:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["He", "Xiang", ""], ["Yener", "Aylin", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.5397", "submitter": "Divyanshu Vats", "authors": "Divyanshu Vats, Jose M.

There exist many\ntechniques to mine access patterns from the web logs. This paper describes the\npowerful algorithm that mines the web logs efficiently. Proposed algorithm\nfirstly converts the web access data available in a special doubly linked tree.\nEach access is called an event. This tree keeps the critical mining related\ninformation in very compressed form based on the frequent event count.
