It is well-known that the computational cost of MIMO detection based\non QR decomposition is directly proportional to the number of non-zero entries\ninvolved in back-substitution and slicing operations in the triangularized\nchannel matrix, which can be too high for low-latency applications involving\nlarge MIMO dimensions. By systematically puncturing the channel to have a\nspecific structure, it is demonstrated that the detection process can be\naccelerated by employing standard schemes such as chase detection, list\ndetection, nulling-and-cancellation detection, and sub-space detection on the\ntransformed matrix. The performance of these schemes is characterized and\nanalyzed mathematically, and bounds on the achievable diversity gain and\nprobability of bit error are derived. Surprisingly, it is shown that puncturing\ndoes not negatively impact the receive diversity gain in hard-output detectors.\nThe analysis is extended to soft-output detection when computing per-layer bit\nlog-likelihood ratios; it is shown that significant performance gains are\nattainable by ordering the layer of interest to be at the root when puncturing\nthe channel. Simulations of coded and uncoded scenarios certify that the\nproposed schemes scale up efficiently both in the number of antennas and\nconstellation size, as well as in the presence of correlated channels.

By taking them into consideration when formulating\ninformation measures, the question is raised on whether and if so how much\ninformation permeates across scales to impact on the macroscale information\nmeasures. The present study investigates and quantifies the emergence of\nmacroscale information from microscale codependence among microphysics. In\norder to isolate the information emergence coming solely from the nonlinearly\ninteracting microphysics, redundancy and synergy are evaluated among macroscale\nvariables that are statistically independent from each other but not\nnecessarily so within their own microphysics. Synergistic and redundant\ninformation are found when microphysical interactions take place, even if the\nstatistical distributions are factorable. These findings stress the added value\nof nonlinear statistical physics to information theory in coevolutionary\nsystems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Dec 2017 11:55:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Perdig\u00e3o", "Rui A.

This paper therefore aims to find a new\nCSMA scheme that combines both throughput optimality and energy efficiency by\nadapting to the throughput and power consumption needs of each link. This is\ndone by controlling operational parameters such as back-off and sleeping timers\nwith the aim of optimizing a certain objective function. The resulting CSMA\nscheme is characterized by being asynchronous, completely distributed and being\nable to adapt to different power consumption profiles required by each link\nwhile still ensuring throughput optimality. The performance gain in terms of\nenergy efficiency compared to the conventional adaptive CSMA scheme is\ndemonstrated through computer simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Dec 2017 13:54:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 11 Aug 2019 21:21:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-13", "authors_parsed": [["Maatouk", "Ali", ""], ["Assaad", "Mohamad", ""], ["Ephremides", "Anthony", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.03278", "submitter": "Milad Bakhshizadeh", "authors": "Milad Bakhshizadeh, Arian Maleki, Shirin Jalali", "title": "Using Black-box Compression Algorithms for Phase Retrieval", "comments": "43 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Compressive phase retrieval refers to the problem of recovering a structured\n$n$-dimensional complex-valued vector from its phase-less under-determined\nlinear measurements. The non-linearity of measurements makes designing\ntheoretically-analyzable efficient phase retrieval algorithms challenging. As a\nresult, to a great extent, algorithms designed in this area are developed to\ntake advantage of simple structures such as sparsity and its convex\ngeneralizations. The goal of this paper is to move beyond simple models through\nemploying compression codes. Such codes are typically developed to take\nadvantage of complex signal models to represent the signals as efficiently as\npossible. In this work, it is shown how an existing compression code can be\ntreated as a black box and integrated into an efficient solution for phase\nretrieval. First, COmpressive PhasE Retrieval (COPER) optimization, a\ncomputationally-intensive compression-based phase retrieval method, is\nproposed. COPER provides a theoretical framework for studying compression-based\nphase retrieval. The number of measurements required by COPER is connected to\n$\\kappa$, the $\\alpha$-dimension (closely related to the rate-distortion\ndimension) of the given family of compression codes. To finds the solution of\nCOPER, an efficient iterative algorithm called gradient descent for COPER\n(GD-COPER) is proposed. It is proven that under some mild conditions on the\ninitialization, if the number of measurements is larger than $ C \\kappa^2\n\\log^2 n$, where $C$ is a constant, GD-COPER obtains an accurate estimate of\nthe input vector in polynomial time. In the simulation results, JPEG2000 is\nintegrated in GD-COPER to confirm the superb performance of the resulting\nalgorithm on real-world images.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Dec 2017 20:46:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 30 Jun 2019 21:33:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 8 Jun 2020 19:28:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Bakhshizadeh", "Milad", ""], ["Maleki", "Arian", ""], ["Jalali", "Shirin", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.03290", "submitter": "Yasaman Keshtkarjahromi", "authors": "Yasaman Keshtkarjahromi, Hulya Seferoglu, Rashid Ansari, Ashfaq\n  Khokhar", "title": "Device-to-Device Networking Meets Cellular via Network Coding", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Utilizing device-to-device (D2D) connections among mobile devices is\npromising to meet the increasing throughput demand over cellular links.

As a result,\nwhen requested, a file can be retrieved by each GN either directly from its\nlocal cache or from its nearest neighbor that has cached the file via\ndevice-to-device (D2D) communications. It is revealed that there exists a\nfundamental trade-off between the file caching cost, which is the total time\nrequired for the UAV to transmit the files to their designated caching GNs, and\nthe file retrieval cost, which is the average time required for serving one\nfile request. To characterize this trade-off, we formulate an optimization\nproblem to minimize the weighted sum of the two costs, via jointly designing\nthe file caching policy, the UAV trajectory and communication scheduling.

Furthermore, we determine the symmetric degrees of freedom where the\nsignal-to-noise, interference-to-noise and jammer-to-noise ratios are all tend\nto infinity. Moreover, we show that, if the jammer has greater received power\nthan the legitimate user, symmetrizability makes the capacity zero. The proof\nof the outer bound is straightforward, while the inner bound generalizes the\nHan-Kobayashi rate splitting scheme. As a novel aspect, the inner bound takes\nadvantage of the common message acting as common randomness for the private\nmessage; hence, the jammer cannot symmetrize only the private codeword without\nbeing detected. This complication requires an extra condition on the signal\npower, so that in general our inner bound is not identical to the Han-Kobayashi\nbound. We also prove a new variation of the packing lemma that applies for\nmultiple Gaussian codebooks in an adversarial setting.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Dec 2017 05:09:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-13", "authors_parsed": [["Hosseinigoki", "Fatemeh", ""], ["Kosut", "Oliver", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.04135", "submitter": "Aidin Ferdowsi", "authors": "Aidin Ferdowsi, Ursula Challita, Walid Saad", "title": "Deep Learning for Reliable Mobile Edge Analytics in Intelligent\n  Transportation Systems", "comments": "5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) will be a major component of\ntomorrow's smart cities.

In this respect, we derive\naccurate unified analytical expressions for the ergodic capacity for the\naforementioned protocols over independent but not identically distributed\n(i.n.i.d) $\\alpha$-$\\mu$ fading channels. Three special cases of the\n$\\alpha$-$\\mu$ model, namely, Rayleigh, Nakagami-mandWeibull fading channels\nwere investigated. Our analysis is verified through numerical and simulation\nresults. It is shown that finding the optimal value of the PS factor for the\nPSR protocol and the EH time fraction for the TSR protocol is a crucial step in\nachieving the best network performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Dec 2017 13:05:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-12", "authors_parsed": [["Nauryzbayev", "Galymzhan", ""], ["Rabie", "Khaled M.", ""], ["Abdallah", "Mohamed", ""], ["Adebisi", "Bamidele", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.04767", "submitter": "Qingjiang Shi", "authors": "Qingjiang Shi, Mingyi Hong, Xiao Fu, Tsung-Hui Chang", "title": "Penalty Dual Decomposition Method For Nonsmooth Nonconvex Optimization", "comments": "Two part paper, 27 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Many contemporary signal processing, machine learning and wireless\ncommunication applications can be formulated as nonconvex nonsmooth\noptimization problems.

Practically, the DAPs and\nEAPs may be operated by different operators, and the DAPs thus need to provide\neffective incentives to motivate the surrounding EAPs to charge their\nassociated IoT devices. Different from existing incentive schemes, we consider\na practical scenario with asymmetric information, where the DAP is not aware of\nthe channel conditions and energy costs of the EAPs. We first extend the\nexisting Stackelberg game-based approach with complete information to the\nasymmetric information scenario, where the expected utility of the DAP is\ndefined and maximized. To deal with asymmetric information more efficiently, we\nthen develop a contract theory-based framework, where the optimal contract is\nderived to maximize the DAP's expected utility as well as the social welfare.\nSimulations show that information asymmetry leads to severe performance\ndegradation for the Stackelberg game-based framework, while the proposed\ncontract theory-based approach using asymmetric information outperforms the\nStackelberg game-based method with complete information.

The major distinction between the proposed\nstrategy and the existing ones is that in the existing approaches, each\ntransmitter adapts its transmission strategy only to the fading process of its\ndirect channel to the receiver, hence directly adopting a single-user strategy\npreviously designed for the single-user channels. However, the contribution of\neach user to a network-wide measure (e.g., sum-rate capacity) depends not only\non the user's direct channel to the receiver, but also on the qualities of\nother channels. Driven by this premise, this paper proposes an alternative\nbroadcast strategy in which the transmitters adapt their transmissions to the\ncombined states resulting from all users' channels. This leads to generating a\nlarger number of information streams by each transmitter and adopting a\ndifferent decoding strategy by the receiver. An achievable rate region and an\nouter bound that capture the trade-off among the rates of different information\nlayers are established, and it is shown that the achievable rate region\nsubsumes the existing known capacity regions obtained based on adapting the\nbroadcast approach to the single-user channels.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 23 Dec 2017 06:19:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-27", "authors_parsed": [["Kazemi", "Samia", ""], ["Tajer", "Ali", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.08735", "submitter": "Andrei Nedelcu", "authors": "Andrei Nedelcu and Fabian Steiner and Markus Staudacher and Gerhard\n  Kramer and Wolfgang Zirwas and Rakash Sivasiva Ganesan and Paolo Baracca and\n  Stefan Wesemann", "title": "Quantized Precoding for Multi-Antenna Downlink Channels with MAGIQ", "comments": "extended abstract", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A multi-antenna, greedy, iterative, and quantized (MAGIQ) precoding algorithm\nis proposed for downlink channels.

For\nefficient energy transfer and information relaying, a novel two-phase protocol\nis proposed, in which the relay operates in full-duplex (FD) mode to achieve\nsimultaneous wireless power and information transmission. Compared with those\nexisting protocols, the proposed design possesses two main advantages: 1) it\nfully exploits the available hardware resource (antenna element) of relay and\ncan offer higher secrecy rate; 2) it enables self-energy recycling (S-ER) at\nrelay, in which the loopback interference (LI) generated by FD operation is\nharvested and reused for information relaying. To maximize the worst-case\nsecrecy rate (WCSR) through jointly designing the source and relay beamformers\ncoupled with the power allocation ratio, an optimization problem is formulated.\nThis formulated problem is proved to be non-convex and the challenge to solve\nit is how to concurrently solve out the beamformers and the power allocation\nratio. To cope with this difficulty, an alternative approach is proposed by\nconverting the original problem into three subproblems. By solving these\nsubproblems iteratively, the closed form solutions of robust beamformers and\npower allocation ratio for the original problem are achieved.

In the considered model, the service time is minimized by\nminimizing the wireless transmission time as well as the control time that is\nneeded for movement and stabilization of the drones. To minimize the\ntransmission time, first, the antenna array gain is maximized by optimizing the\ndrone spacing within the array. In this case, using perturbation techniques,\nthe drone spacing optimization problem is addressed by solving successive,\nperturbed convex optimization problems. Then, the optimal locations of the\ndrones around the array's center are derived such that the transmission time\nfor the user is minimized. Given the determined optimal locations of drones,\nthe drones must spend a control time to adjust their positions dynamically so\nas to serve multiple users. To minimize this control time of the quadrotor\ndrones, the speed of rotors is optimally adjusted based on both the\ndestinations of the drones and external forces (e.g., wind and gravity). In\nparticular, using bang-bang control theory, the optimal rotors' speeds as well\nas the minimum control time are derived in closed-form. Simulation results show\nthat the proposed approach can significantly reduce the service time to ground\nusers compared to a fixed-array case in which the same number of drones form a\nfixed uniform antenna array.
