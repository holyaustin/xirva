To address this need, MIMO techniques, which are\ncapable of offering several-fold increase in capacity, hold significant\npromise. Most previous work on capacity analysis of ad-hoc networks is based on\nan implicit assumption that each node has only one antenna. Core to the\nanalysis therein is the characterization of a geometric area, referred to as\nthe exclusion region, which quantizes the amount of spatial resource occupied\nby a link. When multiple antennas are deployed at each node, however, multiple\nlinks can transmit in the vicinity of each other simultaneously, as\ninterference can now be suppressed by spatial signal processing. As such, a\nlink no longer exclusively occupies a geometric area, making the concept of\n\"exclusion region\" not applicable any more. In this paper, we investigate\nlink-layer throughput capacity of MIMO ad-hoc networks. In contrast to previous\nwork, the amount of spatial resource occupied by each link is characterized by\nthe actual interference it imposes on other links. To calculate the link-layer\ncapacity, we first derive the probability distribution of post-detection SINR\nat a receiver. The result is then used to calculate the number of active links\nand the corresponding data rates that can be sustained within an area. Our\nanalysis will serve as a guideline for the design of medium access protocols\nfor MIMO ad-hoc networks.

Three new entropy estimators are introduced. For two of the\nfour LZ-based estimators, a bootstrap procedure is described for evaluating\ntheir standard error, and a practical rule of thumb is heuristically derived\nfor selecting the values of their parameters. ** Theory. We prove that, unlike\ntheir earlier versions, the two new LZ-based estimators are consistent for\nevery finite-valued, stationary and ergodic process. An effective method is\nderived for the accurate approximation of the entropy rate of a finite-state\nHMM with known distribution. Heuristic calculations are presented and\napproximate formulas are derived for evaluating the bias and the standard error\nof each estimator. ** Simulation. All estimators are applied to a wide range of\ndata generated by numerous different processes with varying degrees of\ndependence and memory. Some conclusions drawn from these experiments include:\n(i) For all estimators considered, the main source of error is the bias. (ii)\nThe CTW method is repeatedly and consistently seen to provide the most accurate\nresults. (iii) The performance of the LZ-based estimators is often comparable\nto that of the plug-in method. (iv) The main drawback of the plug-in method is\nits computational inefficiency.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Feb 2008 11:22:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Gao", "Y.", ""], ["Kontoyiannis", "I.", ""], ["Bienenstock", "E.", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.4390", "submitter": "Doron Ezri", "authors": "Vadim Neder, Doron Ezri and Motti Haridim", "title": "Low Complexity Sphere Decoding for Spatial Multiplexing MIMO", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we present a novel method for decoding multiple input -\nmultiple output (MIMO) transmission, which combines sphere decoding (SD) and\nzero forcing (ZF) techniques to provide near optimal low complexity and high\nperformance constant time modified sphere decoding algorithm.
