Despite the rapid progress, the emphasis of the research\ncommunity in the last decade has remained largely concentrated on improving the\ndesign of energy harvester (so-called rectenna) and has left aside the effect\nof transmitter design. In this paper, we study the design of transmit waveform\nso as to enhance the DC power at the output of the rectenna. We derive a\ntractable model of the non-linearity of the rectenna and compare with a linear\nmodel conventionally used in the literature. We then use those models to design\nnovel multisine waveforms that are adaptive to the channel state information\n(CSI). Interestingly, while the linear model favours narrowband transmission\nwith all the power allocated to a single frequency, the non-linear model\nfavours a power allocation over multiple frequencies. Through realistic\nsimulations, waveforms designed based on the non-linear model are shown to\nprovide significant gains (in terms of harvested DC power) over those designed\nbased on the linear model and over non-adaptive waveforms. We also compute\nanalytically the theoretical scaling laws of the harvested energy for various\nwaveforms as a function of the number of sinewaves and transmit antennas. Those\nscaling laws highlight the benefits of CSI knowledge at the transmitter in WPT\nand of a WPT design based on a non-linear rectenna model over a linear model.\nResults also motivate the study of a promising architecture relying on\nlarge-scale multisine multi-antenna waveforms for WPT. As a final note, results\nstress the importance of modeling and accounting for the non-linearity of the\nrectenna in any system design involving wireless power.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Mar 2016 23:00:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 9 Aug 2016 07:52:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Clerckx", "Bruno", ""], ["Bayguzina", "Ekaterina", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.00107", "submitter": "Marwen Zorgui", "authors": "Marwen Zorgui, Zouheir Rezki, Basel Alomair, and Mohamed-Slim Alouini", "title": "Secret-Key Agreement with Public Discussion subject to an Amplitude\n  Constraint", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2551218", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper considers the problem of secret-key agreement with public\ndiscussion subject to a peak power constraint $A$ on the channel input.

By launching data injection attacks, an adversary can\nmanipulate the real-time locational marginal prices to obtain economic\nbenefits. Despite the surge of existing literature on data injection, most such\nworks assume the presence of a single attacker and assume no cost for attack or\ndefense. In contrast, in this paper, a model for data injection attacks with\nmultiple adversaries and a single smart grid defender is introduced. To study\nthe defender-attackers interaction, two game models are considered. In the\nfirst, a Stackelberg game model is used in which the defender acts as a leader\nthat can anticipate the actions of the adversaries, that act as followers,\nbefore deciding on which measurements to protect. The existence and properties\nof the Stackelberg equilibrium of this game are studied. To find the\nequilibrium, a distributed learning algorithm that operates under limited\nsystem information is proposed and shown to converge to the game solution. In\nthe second proposed game model, it is considered that the defender cannot\nanticipate the actions of the adversaries. To this end, we proposed a hybrid\nsatisfaction equilibrium - Nash equilibrium game and defined its equilibrium\nconcept. A search algorithm is also provided to find the equilibrium of the\nhybrid game. Numerical results using the IEEE 30-bus system are used to\nillustrate and analyze the strategic interactions between the attackers and\ndefender. Our results show that by defending a very small set of measurements,\nthe grid operator can achieve an equilibrium through which the optimal attacks\nhave no effect on the system.

Estimating the\nsupport of a set of signals and their DOAs is crucial to many signal processing\napplications, such as Cognitive Radio (CR). A challenging scenario, faced by\nCRs, is that of multiband signals, composed of several narrowband transmissions\nspread over a wide spectrum each with unknown carrier frequencies and DOAs. The\nNyquist rate of such signals is high and constitutes a bottleneck both in the\nanalog and digital domains. To alleviate the sampling rate issue, several\nsub-Nyquist sampling methods, such as multicoset sampling or the modulated\nwideband converter (MWC), have been proposed in the context of spectrum\nsensing. In this work, we first suggest an alternative sub-Nyquist sampling and\nsignal reconstruction method to the MWC, based on a uniform linear array (ULA).\nWe then extend our approach to joint spectrum sensing and DOA estimation and\npropose the CompreSsed CArrier and DOA Estimation (CaSCADE) system, composed of\nan L-shaped array with two ULAs. In both cases, we derive perfect recovery\nconditions of the signal parameters (carrier frequencies and DOAs if relevant)\nand the signal itself and provide two reconstruction algorithms, one based on\nthe ESPRIT method and the second on compressed sensing techniques. Both our\njoint carriers and DOAs recovery algorithms overcome the well-known pairing\nissue between the two parameters. Simulations demonstrate that our alternative\nspectrum sensing system outperforms the MWC in terms of recovery error and\ndesign complexity and show joint carrier frequencies and DOAs from our CaSCADE\nsystem's sub-Nyquist samples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 10 Apr 2016 18:54:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-12", "authors_parsed": [["Stein", "Shahar", ""], ["Yair", "Or", ""], ["Cohen", "Deborah", ""], ["Eldar", "Yonina C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.02730", "submitter": "Samir Hod\\v{z}i\\'c", "authors": "S.

In addition to modeling the effect of\nretransmission on the network performance, the developed mathematical model\npresents twofold analysis unification for MIMO cellular networks literature.\nFirst, it integrates the tangible decoding error probability and the abstracted\n(i.e., modulation scheme and receiver type agnostic) outage probability\nanalysis, which are largely disjoint in the literature. Second, it unifies the\nanalysis for different MIMO configurations. The unified MIMO analysis is\nachieved by abstracting unnecessary information conveyed within the interfering\nsignals by Gaussian signaling approximation along with an equivalent SISO\nrepresentation for the per-data stream SINR in MIMO cellular networks.

In this\npaper, a new bound is obtained for the exact reconstruction of every $K$-sparse\nsignal via the gOMP algorithm in the noiseless case.

For any\ngiven positive integer $K$, we construct a matrix $A$ with the RIC\n\\begin{eqnarray*} \\delta_{NK+1}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{N}+1}} \\end{eqnarray*}\nsuch that the gOMP may fail to recover some $K$-sparse signal $x$.\n  In the noise case, an extra condition on the minimum magnitude of the nonzero\ncomponents of every $K-$sparse signal combining with the above bound on RIC of\nthe sensing matrix $A$ is sufficient to recover the true support of every\n$K$-sparse signal by the gOMP.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Apr 2016 08:53:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-15", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Wengu", ""], ["Ge", "Huanmin", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.03322", "submitter": "Mike Koivisto", "authors": "Mike Koivisto, M\\'ario Costa, Janis Werner, Kari Heiska, Jukka\n  Talvitie, Kari Lepp\\\"anen, Visa Koivunen and Mikko Valkama", "title": "Joint Device Positioning and Clock Synchronization in 5G Ultra-Dense\n  Networks", "comments": "Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications in March\n  2016.

Building on the premises of ultra-dense networks as well as on\nthe adoption of multicarrier waveforms and antenna arrays in the access nodes\n(ANs), we first formulate extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based solutions for\ncomputationally efficient joint estimation and tracking of the time of arrival\n(ToA) and direction of arrival (DoA) of the user nodes (UNs) using uplink\nreference signals. Then, a second EKF stage is proposed in order to fuse the\nindividual DoA/ToA estimates from one or several ANs into a UN position\nestimate. Since all the processing takes place at the network side, the\ncomputing complexity and energy consumption at the UN side are kept to a\nminimum. The cascaded EKFs proposed in this article also take into account the\nunavoidable relative clock offsets between UNs and ANs, such that reliable\nclock synchronization of the access-link is obtained as a valuable by-product.\nThe proposed cascaded EKF scheme is then revised and extended to more general\nand challenging scenarios where not only the UNs have clock offsets against the\nnetwork time, but also the ANs themselves are not mutually synchronized in\ntime. Finally, comprehensive performance evaluations of the proposed solutions\non a realistic 5G network setup, building on the METIS project based outdoor\nMadrid map model together with complete ray tracing based propagation modeling,\nare provided. The obtained results clearly demonstrate that by using the\ndeveloped methods, sub-meter scale positioning and tracking accuracy of moving\ndevices is indeed technically feasible in future 5G radio access networks\noperating at sub-6GHz frequencies, despite the realistic assumptions related to\nclock offsets and potentially even under unsynchronized network elements.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Apr 2016 09:39:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 23 Nov 2016 10:23:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 24 Nov 2016 10:33:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-28", "authors_parsed": [["Koivisto", "Mike", ""], ["Costa", "M\u00e1rio", ""], ["Werner", "Janis", ""], ["Heiska", "Kari", ""], ["Talvitie", "Jukka", ""], ["Lepp\u00e4nen", "Kari", ""], ["Koivunen", "Visa", ""], ["Valkama", "Mikko", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.03330", "submitter": "Trung Kien Vu", "authors": "Trung Kien Vu and Sungoh Kwon", "title": "Mobility-Assisted on-Demand Routing Algorithm for MANETs in the Presence\n  of Location Errors", "comments": "Special Issues on Recent Advances in Communications and Networking,\n  The Scientific World Journal, 11 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1155/2014/790103", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a mobility-assisted on-demand routing algorithm for mobile ad hoc\nnetworks in the presence of location errors.

For stationary\nGuassian process, the excess entropy characterization of long memory relates to\npopular characterization well. It is proved that the excess entropy of\nfractional Gaussian noise is infinite if the Hurst parameter $H \\in (1/2, 1)$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Apr 2016 07:16:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["Ding", "Yiming", ""], ["Xiang", "Xuyan", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.05483", "submitter": "Ioannis Krikidis", "authors": "Ioannis Krikidis", "title": "SWIPT in 3-D Bipolar Ad Hoc Networks with Sectorized Antennas", "comments": "IEEE Communications Letters (accepted for publication)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2557319", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this letter, we study the simultaneous wireless information and power\ntransfer (SWIPT) concept in 3-D bipolar ad hoc networks with spatial\nrandomness.

This raises the\nfollowing question:Is high-dimensional agnostic distribution learning even\npossible, algorithmically?\n  In this work, we obtain the first computationally efficient algorithms with\ndimension-independent error guarantees for agnostically learning several\nfundamental classes of high-dimensional distributions: (1) a single Gaussian,\n(2) a product distribution on the hypercube, (3) mixtures of two product\ndistributions (under a natural balancedness condition), and (4) mixtures of\nspherical Gaussians. Our algorithms achieve error that is independent of the\ndimension, and in many cases scales nearly-linearly with the fraction of\nadversarially corrupted samples. Moreover, we develop a general recipe for\ndetecting and correcting corruptions in high-dimensions, that may be applicable\nto many other problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Apr 2016 19:54:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 15 Mar 2019 02:31:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-18", "authors_parsed": [["Diakonikolas", "Ilias", ""], ["Kamath", "Gautam", ""], ["Kane", "Daniel", ""], ["Li", "Jerry", ""], ["Moitra", "Ankur", ""], ["Stewart", "Alistair", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.06510", "submitter": "Ignacio Zurri\\'an", "authors": "F.
