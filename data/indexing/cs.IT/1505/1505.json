An issue is how to contain the estimation errors of the\nchannel parameters of the multiple users, considering that the overall\nestimation errors may increase with the number of users because the estimations\nof their channel parameters are intertwined with each other. The second\nchallenge is that the transmitters of the multiple users may be driven by\ndifferent RF oscillators. The associated frequency asynchrony may cause\nmultiple CFOs at the receiver. Compared with a single-user receiver where the\nsingle CFO can be compensated away, a particular difficulty for a multiuser\nreceiver is that it is not possible to compensate for all the multiple CFOs\nsimultaneously. To tackle the two challenges, we put forth a framework to solve\nthe problems of multiuser channel-parameter estimation, CFO compensation, and\nchannel decoding jointly and iteratively. The framework employs the space\nalternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algortihm to decompose\nthe multisuser problem into multiple single-user problems, and the\nexpectation-conditional maximization (ECM) algorithm to tackle each of the\nsingle-user subproblems.

Based on this technique, three explicit constructions of\nMSR codes are given. The first two constructions provide access-optimal MSR\ncodes, with two and three parities, respectively, which attain the\nsub-packetization bound for access-optimal codes. The third construction\nprovides longer MSR codes with three parities, which are not access-optimal,\nand do not necessarily attain the sub-packetization bound.\n  In addition to a minimum storage in a node, all three constructions allow the\nentire data to be recovered from a minimal number of storage nodes.

Since the distribution function of a sum of\nDouble GG random variables (RVs) appears in BER expression, we first derive a\nclosed-form upper bound for the distribution of the sum of Double GG\ndistributed RVs. A novel union upper bound for the average BER as well as\ncorresponding asymptotic expression is then derived and evaluated in terms of\nMeijer's G-functions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 May 2015 19:17:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-21", "authors_parsed": [["Aminikashani", "Mohammadreza", ""], ["Kavehrad", "Mohsen", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.02186", "submitter": "Heide Gluesing-Luerssen", "authors": "Heide Gluesing-Luerssen and Carolyn Troha", "title": "Construction of Subspace Codes through Linkage", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.CO math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A construction is presented that allows to produce subspace codes of long\nlength using subspace codes of shorter length in combination with a rank metric\ncode.

A common strategy is to evaluate a measure of\ndependence on every variable pair and retain the highest-scoring pairs for\nfollow-up. This strategy works well if the statistic used is equitable [Reshef\net al. 2015a], i.e., if, for some measure of noise, it assigns similar scores\nto equally noisy relationships regardless of relationship type (e.g., linear,\nexponential, periodic).\n  In this paper, we introduce and characterize a population measure of\ndependence called MIC*. We show three ways that MIC* can be viewed: as the\npopulation value of MIC, a highly equitable statistic from [Reshef et al.\n2011], as a canonical \"smoothing\" of mutual information, and as the supremum of\nan infinite sequence defined in terms of optimal one-dimensional partitions of\nthe marginals of the joint distribution. Based on this theory, we introduce an\nefficient approach for computing MIC* from the density of a pair of random\nvariables, and we define a new consistent estimator MICe for MIC* that is\nefficiently computable. In contrast, there is no known polynomial-time\nalgorithm for computing the original equitable statistic MIC. We show through\nsimulations that MICe has better bias-variance properties than MIC. We then\nintroduce and prove the consistency of a second statistic, TICe, that is a\ntrivial side-product of the computation of MICe and whose goal is powerful\nindependence testing rather than equitability.\n  We show in simulations that MICe and TICe have good equitability and power\nagainst independence respectively.

This can be accomplished by computing a measure\nof dependence on all variable pairs and examining the highest-scoring pairs,\nprovided the measure of dependence used assigns similar scores to equally noisy\nrelationships of different types. This property, called equitability, is\nformalized in Reshef et al. [2015b]. In addition to equitability, measures of\ndependence can also be assessed by the power of their corresponding\nindependence tests as well as their runtime.\n  Here we present extensive empirical evaluation of the equitability, power\nagainst independence, and runtime of several leading measures of dependence.\nThese include two statistics introduced in Reshef et al. [2015a]: MICe, which\nhas equitability as its primary goal, and TICe, which has power against\nindependence as its goal. Regarding equitability, our analysis finds that MICe\nis the most equitable method on functional relationships in most of the\nsettings we considered, although mutual information estimation proves the most\nequitable at large sample sizes in some specific settings. Regarding power\nagainst independence, we find that TICe, along with Heller and Gorfine's S^DDP,\nis the state of the art on the relationships we tested. Our analyses also show\na trade-off between power against independence and equitability consistent with\nthe theory in Reshef et al. [2015b]. In terms of runtime, MICe and TICe are\nsignificantly faster than many other measures of dependence tested, and\ncomputing either one makes computing the other trivial.

To study and explain this behavior, this paper focuses on general\nsingle-tier network models with nearest-base station association and studies\nthe asymptotic gain both at 0 and at infinity.\n  We show that the gain at 0 is determined by the so-called mean\ninterference-to-signal ratio (MISR) between the PPP and the network model under\nconsideration, while the gain at infinity is determined by the expected\nfading-to-interference ratio (EFIR).\n  The analysis of the MISR is based on a novel type of point process, the\nso-called relative distance process, which is a one-dimensional point process\non the unit interval [0,1] that fully determines the SIR. A comparison of the\ngains at 0 and infinity shows that the gain at 0 indeed provides an excellent\napproximation for the entire SIR distribution.

The cost of PIR\nprotocols is usually measured in terms of their communication complexity, which\nis the total number of bits exchanged between the user and the servers, and\nstorage overhead, which is the ratio between the total number of bits stored on\nall the servers and the number of bits in the database.

In this paper we propose new explicit construction of real valued\nRIP measurement matrices in compressed sensing from algebraic geometry. Our\nconstruction indicates that using more general algebraic-geometric objects\nrather than curves (AG codes), RIP measurement matrices in compressed sensing\ncan be constructed with much smaller coherence and much bigger sparsity orders.\nThe RIP matrices from algebraic geometry also have a nice asymptotic bound\nmatching the bound from the previous constructions of Bourgain et al and the\nsmall-bias sets. On the negative side, we prove that the RIP matrices from\nDeVore's construction, its direct algebraic geometric generalization and one of\nour new construction do not satisfy the strong coherence property. However we\ngive a modified version of AG-RIP matrices which satisfies the strong coherence\nproperty. Therefore the new RIP matrices in compressed sensing from our\nmodified algebraic geometric construction can be used for the recovery of\nsignals from the noisy measurement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 May 2015 20:47:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Hao", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.07493", "submitter": "Steve Szabo", "authors": "Steve Szabo and Felix Ulmer", "title": "Duality Preserving Gray Maps for Codes over Rings", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT math.RA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Given a finite ring $A$ which is a free left module over a subring $R$ of\n$A$, two types of $R$-bases, pseudo-self-dual bases (similar to trace\northogonal bases) and symmetric bases, are defined which in turn are used to\ndefine duality preserving maps from codes over $A$ to codes over $R$.
