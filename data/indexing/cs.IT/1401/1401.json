In fact it's common for\neconophysicists to estimate maximal Lyapunov exponent for log returns of a\ngiven financial asset to confirm that prices behave chaotically.

The molecules arriving in\nthe following slots become an interference source when detection takes place.\nEnd-to-end simulator enables us to analyze the effect of inter symbol\ninterference (ISI) without making any assumptions on the ISI. We propose an ISI\ncancellation technique that utilizes decision feedback for compensating the\neffect of previously demodulated symbol. Three different modulation types are\nconsidered with pulse, square, and cosine carrier waves. In case of constraints\non transmitter or receiver node it may not be possible to use pulse as a\ncarrier, and peak-to-average messenger molecule metric is defined for this\npurpose. Results show that, the proposed ISI mitigation technique improves the\nsymbol detection performance and the amplitude-based modulations are improved\nmore than frequency-based modulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 02:26:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-16", "authors_parsed": [["Yilmaz", "H.

The parties can switch their paths after\nevery $\\lambda$ bits of communication. We study perfect (P)-PMT versus\nasymptotically-perfect (AP)-PMT protocols. The former has zero tolerance of\ntransmission error and leakage, whereas the latter allows for positive error\nand leakage that tend to zero as the message length increases. We derive the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions under which P-PMT and AP-PMT are possible.\nWe also introduce explicit P-PMT and AP-PMT constructions. Our results show\nAP-PMT protocols attain much higher information rates than P-PMT ones.\nInterestingly, AP-PMT is possible even in poorest condition where $t_a=t_b=1$\nand $t_e=n-1$. It remains however an open question whether the derived rates\ncan be improved by more sophisticated AP-PMT protocols.\n  We study applications of our results to private communication over the\nreal-life scenarios of multiple-frequency links and multiple-route networks. We\nshow practical examples of such scenarios that can be abstracted by the\nmultipath setting: Our results prove the possibility of keyless\ninformation-theoretic private message transmission at rates $17\\%$ and $20\\%$\nfor the two example scenarios, respectively. We discuss open problems and\nfuture work at the end.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 16:48:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-16", "authors_parsed": [["Ahmadi", "Hadi", ""], ["Safavi-Naini", "Reihaneh", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.3660", "submitter": "Andrea Munari", "authors": "Andrea Munari, Michael Heindlmaier, Gianluigi Liva, Matteo Berioli", "title": "The Throughput of Slotted Aloha with Diversity", "comments": "Accepted for publications at 51st Annual Allerton Conference on\n  Communication, Control, and Computing", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, a simple variation of classical Slotted Aloha is introduced\nand analyzed.

Especially\nthe measure of information transfer, transfer entropy, has seen a dramatic\nsurge of interest in neuroscience. Estimating transfer entropy from two\nprocesses requires the observation of multiple realizations of these processes\nto estimate associated probability density functions. To obtain these\nobservations, available estimators assume stationarity of processes to allow\npooling of observations over time. This assumption however, is a major obstacle\nto the application of these estimators in neuroscience as observed processes\nare often non-stationary. As a solution, Gomez-Herrero and colleagues\ntheoretically showed that the stationarity assumption may be avoided by\nestimating transfer entropy from an ensemble of realizations. Such an ensemble\nis often readily available in neuroscience experiments in the form of\nexperimental trials. Thus, in this work we combine the ensemble method with a\nrecently proposed transfer entropy estimator to make transfer entropy\nestimation applicable to non-stationary time series. We present an efficient\nimplementation of the approach that deals with the increased computational\ndemand of the ensemble method's practical application. In particular, we use a\nmassively parallel implementation for a graphics processing unit to handle the\ncomputationally most heavy aspects of the ensemble method.

Therefore, without energy-aware transmission\nschemes, energy can deplete from sensor nodes with smaller energy budget faster\nthan from the rest of the sensor nodes in WSNs. This reduces the coverage area\nas well as the lifetime of WSNs.

Initially, the analysis of RCs was based on the\nassumption that during the repair process, the newcomer does not distinguish\n(among all surviving nodes) which nodes to access, i.e., the newcomer is\noblivious to the set of helpers being used. Such a scheme is termed the blind\nrepair (BR) scheme. Nonetheless, it is intuitive in practice that the newcomer\nshould choose to access only those \"good\" helpers. In this paper, a new\ncharacterization of the effect of choosing the helper nodes in terms of the\nstorage-bandwidth tradeoff is given. Specifically, answers to the following\nfundamental questions are given: Under what conditions does proactively\nchoosing the helper nodes improve the storage-bandwidth tradeoff? Can this\nimprovement be analytically quantified?\n  This paper answers the former question by providing a necessary and\nsufficient condition under which optimally choosing good helpers strictly\nimproves the storage-bandwidth tradeoff. To answer the latter question, a\nlow-complexity helper selection solution, termed the family repair (FR) scheme,\nis proposed and the corresponding storage/repair-bandwidth curve is\ncharacterized. For example, consider a distributed storage network with 60\ntotal number of nodes and the network is resilient against 50 node failures. If\nthe number of helper nodes is 10, then the FR scheme and its variant\ndemonstrate 27% reduction in the repair-bandwidth when compared to the BR\nsolution. This paper also proves that under some design parameters, the FR\nscheme is indeed optimal among all helper selection schemes.

The research\nis explicitly carried out on arbitrarily varying quantum channels (AVQCs). We\ngive an explicit example that answers the recent question whether the\ntransmission of messages over AVQCs can benefit from distribution of randomness\nbetween the legitimate sender and receiver in the affirmative. The specific\nclass of channels introduced in that example is then extended to show that the\ndeterministic capacity does have discontinuity points, while that behaviour is,\nat the same time, not generic: We show that it is continuous around its\npositivity points. This is in stark contrast to the randomness-assisted\ncapacity, which is always continuous in the channel. Our results imply that the\ndeterministic message transmission capacity of an AVQC can be discontinuous\nonly in points where it is zero, while the randomness assisted capacity is\nnonzero. Apart from the zero-error capacities, this is the first result that\nshows a discontinuity of a capacity for a large class of quantum channels. The\ncontinuity of the respective capacity for memoryless quantum channels had,\namong others, been listed as an open problem on the problem page of the ITP\nHannover for about six years before it was proven to be continuous.

The combined\nattributes of cooperation and adaptation are necessary to enable networks of\ndetectors to continually learn from streaming data and to continually track\ndrifts in the state of nature when deciding in favor of one hypothesis or\nanother. The results in the paper establish a fundamental scaling law for the\nsteady-state probabilities of miss-detection and false-alarm in the slow\nadaptation regime, when the agents interact with each other according to\ndistributed strategies that employ small constant step-sizes. The latter are\ncritical to enable continuous adaptation and learning. The work establishes\nthree key results. First, it is shown that the output of the collaborative\nprocess at each agent has a steady-state distribution. Second, it is shown that\nthis distribution is asymptotically Gaussian in the slow adaptation regime of\nsmall step-sizes. And third, by carrying out a detailed large deviations\nanalysis, closed-form expressions are derived for the decaying rates of the\nfalse-alarm and miss-detection probabilities. Interesting insights are gained.\nIn particular, it is verified that as the step-size $\\mu$ decreases, the error\nprobabilities are driven to zero exponentially fast as functions of $1/\\mu$,\nand that the error exponents increase linearly in the number of agents. It is\nalso verified that the scaling laws governing errors of detection and errors of\nestimation over networks behave very differently, with the former having an\nexponential decay proportional to $1/\\mu$, while the latter scales linearly\nwith decay proportional to $\\mu$.

A binary\nself-orthogonal code is called semi self-dual if it contains the all-ones\nvector and is of codimension 2 in its dual code. We prove upper bounds on the\ndual distance of semi self-dual codes. As an application we get the following:\nlet C be an extremal self-dual binary linear code of length 24m and s in Aut(C)\nbe a fixed point free automorphism of order 2. If m is odd or if m=2k with\nbinom{5k-1}{k-1} odd then C is a free F_2<s>-module. This result has quite\nstrong consequences on the structure of the automorphism group of such codes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Jan 2014 16:22:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 24 Nov 2014 11:14:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-25", "authors_parsed": [["Borello", "Martino", ""], ["Nebe", "Gabriele", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.6039", "submitter": "Marco Dalai", "authors": "Marco Dalai and Andreas Winter", "title": "Constant Compositions in the Sphere Packing Bound for Classical-Quantum\n  Channels", "comments": "ISIT 2014.

The deletion channel is represented by a\nhypergraph whose edges are the deletion balls (or spheres), so that a\ndeletion-correcting code becomes a matching in this hypergraph. Consequently, a\nbound on the size of such a code can be obtained from bounds on the matching\nnumber of a hypergraph. Classical results in hypergraph theory are then invoked\nto compute an upper bound on the matching number as a solution to a\nlinear-programming problem.\n  The method by Kulkarni and Kiyavash can be applied not only for the deletion\nchannel but also for other error channels. This paper studies this method in\nits most general setup. First, it is shown that if the error channel is regular\nand symmetric then this upper bound coincides with the sphere packing bound and\nthus is called the generalized sphere packing bound. Even though this bound is\nexplicitly given by a linear programming problem, finding its exact value may\nstill be a challenging task. In order to simplify the complexity of the\nproblem, we present a technique based upon graph automorphisms that in many\ncases reduces the number of variables and constraints in the problem.

To realize\nsufficient link margin, mmWave systems will employ directional beamforming with\nlarge antenna arrays at both the transmitter and receiver. Due to the high cost\nand power consumption of gigasample mixed-signal devices, mmWave precoding will\nlikely be divided among the analog and digital domains. The large number of\nantennas and the presence of analog beamforming requires the development of\nmmWave-specific channel estimation and precoding algorithms. This paper\ndevelops an adaptive algorithm to estimate the mmWave channel parameters that\nexploits the poor scattering nature of the channel. To enable the efficient\noperation of this algorithm, a novel hierarchical multi-resolution codebook is\ndesigned to construct training beamforming vectors with different beamwidths.\nFor single-path channels, an upper bound on the estimation error probability\nusing the proposed algorithm is derived, and some insights into the efficient\nallocation of the training power among the adaptive stages of the algorithm are\nobtained. The adaptive channel estimation algorithm is then extended to the\nmulti-path case relying on the sparse nature of the channel. Using the\nestimated channel, this paper proposes a new hybrid analog/digital precoding\nalgorithm that overcomes the hardware constraints on the analog-only\nbeamforming, and approaches the performance of digital solutions. Simulation\nresults show that the proposed low-complexity channel estimation algorithm\nachieves comparable precoding gains compared to exhaustive channel training\nalgorithms.

In this paper, the 2-user IC is\naltered by introducing an additional transmitter that wants to communicate with\none of the receivers of the IC. The resulting network thus consists of a\npoint-to-point channel interfering with a multiple access channel (MAC) and is\ndenoted PIMAC. The sum-capacity of the PIMAC is studied with main focus on the\noptimality of TIN. It turns out that TIN in its naive variant, where all\ntransmitters are active and both receivers use TIN for decoding, is not the\nbest choice for the PIMAC. In fact, a scheme that combines both time division\nmultiple access and TIN (TDMA-TIN) strictly outperforms the naive-TIN scheme.\nFurthermore, it is shown that in some regimes, TDMA-TIN achieves the\nsum-capacity for the deterministic PIMAC and the sum-capacity within a constant\ngap for the Gaussian PIMAC. Additionally, it is shown that, even for very-weak\ninterference, there are some regimes where a combination of interference\nalignment with power control and treating interference as noise at the receiver\nside outperforms TDMA-TIN. As a consequence, on the one hand treating\ninterference as noise in a cellular uplink is approximately optimal in certain\nregimes.
