In this paper, by making use of\nmultiuser detection (MUD) and network coding, cooperative transmission\nprotocols with high spectral efficiency, diversity order, and coding gain are\ndeveloped. Compared with the traditional cooperative transmission protocols\nwith single-user detection, in which the diversity gain is only for one source\nuser, the proposed MUD cooperative transmission protocols have the merit that\nthe improvement of one user's link can also benefit the other users. In\naddition, using MUD at the relay provides an environment in which network\ncoding can be employed.
