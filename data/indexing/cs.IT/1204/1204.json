This paper shows that cooperation has fundamental\nlimitations. The main result is that even full cooperation between transmitters\ncannot in general change an interference-limited network to a noise-limited\nnetwork. The key idea is that there exists a spectral efficiency upper bound\nthat is independent of the transmit power. First, a spectral efficiency upper\nbound is established for systems that rely on pilot-assisted channel\nestimation; in this framework, cooperation is shown to be possible only within\nclusters of limited size, which are subject to out-of-cluster interference\nwhose power scales with that of the in-cluster signals. Second, an upper bound\nis also shown to exist when cooperation is through noncoherent communication;\nthus, the spectral efficiency limitation is not a by-product of the reliance on\npilot-assisted channel estimation. Consequently, existing literature that\nroutinely assumes the high-power spectral efficiency scales with the log of the\ntransmit power provides only a partial characterization. The complete\ncharacterization proposed in this paper subdivides the high-power regime into a\ndegrees-of-freedom regime, where the scaling with the log of the transmit power\nholds approximately, and a saturation regime, where the spectral efficiency\nhits a ceiling that is independent of the power. Using a cellular system as an\nexample, it is demonstrated that the spectral efficiency saturates at power\nlevels of operational relevance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Mar 2012 20:11:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["Lozano", "Angel", ""], ["Heath", "Robert W.", "Jr."], ["Andrews", "Jeffrey G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.0029", "submitter": "Alexandros Manolakos", "authors": "Alexandros Manolakos, Yair Noam and Andrea J.

The energy harvesting rate is assumed to be a random\nvariable that is constant over the time interval of interest. A\nsave-then-transmit (ST) protocol is introduced, in which a fraction of time\n{\\rho} (dubbed the save-ratio) is devoted exclusively to energy harvesting,\nwith the remaining fraction 1 - {\\rho} used for data transmission. The ratio of\nthe energy obtainable from an ESD to the energy harvested is termed the energy\nstorage efficiency, {\\eta}. We address the practical case of the secondary ESD\nbeing a battery with {\\eta} < 1, and the main ESD being a super-capacitor with\n{\\eta} = 1. The optimal save-ratio that minimizes outage probability is\nderived, from which some useful design guidelines are drawn.

Therefore,\nit is important to investigate when the receiver should switch between the two\nmodes of information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH), based on the\ninstantaneous channel and interference condition. In this paper, we derive the\noptimal mode switching rule at the receiver to achieve various trade-offs\nbetween wireless information transfer and energy harvesting. Specifically, we\ndetermine the minimum transmission outage probability for delay-limited\ninformation transfer and the maximum ergodic capacity for no-delay-limited\ninformation transfer versus the maximum average energy harvested at the\nreceiver, which are characterized by the boundary of so-called \"outage-energy\"\nregion and \"rate-energy\" region, respectively.

The intelligent relays are\nable to gather channel state information, perform linear processing and forward\nsignals whereas the dumb relays is only able to serve as amplifiers. As the\ndumb relays are oblivious to the source and destination nodes, the wireless\nnetwork can be modeled as a relay network with *smart instantaneous relay*\nonly: the signals of source-destination arrive at the same time as\nsource-relay-destination. Recently, instantaneous relaying is shown to improve\nthe degrees-of-freedom of the network as compared to classical cut-set bound.\nIn this paper, we study an achievable rate region and its boundary of the\ninstantaneous interference relay channel in the scenario of (a) uninformed\nnon-cooperative source-destination nodes (source and destination nodes are not\naware of the existence of the relay and are non-cooperative) and (b) informed\nand cooperative source-destination nodes. Further, we examine the performance\nof interference neutralization: a relay strategy which is able to cancel\ninterference signals at each destination node in the air. We observe that\ninterference neutralization, although promise to achieve desired\ndegrees-of-freedom, may not be feasible if relay has limited power. Simulation\nresults show that the optimal relay strategies improve the achievable rate\nregion and provide better user-fairness in both uninformed non-cooperative and\ninformed cooperative scenarios.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Apr 2012 12:45:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 9 May 2012 10:49:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Ho", "Zuleita", ""], ["Jorswieck", "Eduard", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.5059", "submitter": "Urs Niesen", "authors": "Nikhil Karamchandani, Urs Niesen, Suhas Diggavi", "title": "Computation over Mismatched Channels", "comments": "23 pages, to appear in IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in\n  Communications", "journal-ref": "IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, vol. 31, pp. 666\n  - 677, April 2013", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the problem of distributed computation of a target function over\na multiple-access channel.

As the channel noise\napproaches the Shannon limit, it is still possible to perform correction,\nalthough its cost increases to infinity. In many applications, the implemented\ndecoder can essentially outperform both LDPC and TC.
