An important question is whether the costly\nChannel State Information (CSI) acquisition procedure is necessary for optimum\nperformance. In this paper, we shed some light into this matter by evaluating\nCSI-based and CSI-free multi-antenna WET schemes in a setup with WET in the\ndownlink, and periodic or Poisson-traffic Wireless Information Transfer (WIT)\nin the uplink. When CSI is available, we show that a maximum ratio transmission\nbeamformer is close to optimum whenever the farthest node experiences at least\n3 dB of power attenuation more than the remaining devices. On the other hand,\nalthough the adopted CSI-free mechanism is not capable of providing average\nharvesting gains, it does provide greater WET/WIT diversity with lower energy\nrequirements when compared with the CSI-based scheme. Our numerical results\nevidence that the CSI-free scheme performs favorably under periodic traffic\nconditions, but it may be deficient in case of Poisson traffic, specially if\nthe setup is not optimally configured.

The estimate is recycled to reduce the\nSignal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of an orthogonal channel that is experiencing\ncorrelated noise and so improve the accuracy of its decoding. In this design,\nchannels only aid each other only through the provision of noise estimates\npost-decoding.\n  For a system with arbitrary noise correlation between orthogonal channels\nexperiencing potentially distinct conditions, we introduce an algorithm that\ndetermines a static decoding order that maximizes total effective SNR. We prove\nthat this solution results in higher effective SNR than independent decoding,\nwhich in turn leads to a larger rate region.

In order to provide formal privacy\nguarantees, however, it is generally necessary to put in place additional\nmasking mechanisms. When FL is implemented in wireless systems via uncoded\ntransmission, the channel noise can directly act as a privacy-inducing\nmechanism. This paper demonstrates that, as long as the privacy constraint\nlevel, measured via differential privacy (DP), is below a threshold that\ndecreases with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), uncoded transmission achieves\nprivacy \"for free\", i.e., without affecting the learning performance. More\ngenerally, this work studies adaptive power allocation (PA) for decentralized\ngradient descent in wireless FL with the aim of minimizing the learning\noptimality gap under privacy and power constraints.

In case of\nconstant-composition (CC) distribution matching (CCDM), the sequences differ\nonly in the ordering of their constituent symbols, whereas the number of\noccurrences of each symbol is constant in every output block. Recent results by\nAmari \\textit{et al.} have shown that the CCDM block length can have a\nconsiderable impact on the effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) after fiber\ntransmission.

This paper is devoted to a\ndetailed analysis of the nonlinear fiber interactions for CC sequences. We\nconfirm in fiber simulations the inverse proportionality of SNR with CCDM block\nlength and present two explanations. The first one, which only holds in the\nshort-length regime, is based on how two-dimensional symbols are generated from\nshaped amplitudes in the PAS framework. The second, more general explanation\nrelates to an induced shuffling within a sequence, or equivalently a limited\nconcentration of identical symbols, that is an inherent property for short CC\nblocks, yet not necessarily present for long blocks. This temporal property\nresults in weaker nonlinear interactions, and thus higher SNR, for short CC\nsequences. For a typical multi-span fiber setup, the SNR difference is\nnumerically demonstrated to be up to 0.7dB. Finally, we evaluate a heuristic\nfigure of merit that captures the number of runs of identical symbols in a\nconcatenation of several CC sequences. For moderate block lengths up to\napproximately 100 symbols, this metric suggests that limiting the number of\nidentical-symbol runs can be beneficial.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 12 Jun 2020 09:50:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-15", "authors_parsed": [["Fehenberger", "Tobias", ""], ["Millar", "David S.", ""], ["Koike-Akino", "Toshiaki", ""], ["Kojima", "Keisuke", ""], ["Parsons", "Kieran", ""], ["Griesser", "Helmut", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.07045", "submitter": "Tobias Fehenberger", "authors": "Tobias Fehenberger, David S.

Epistemological issues in the form of\nthe \"unfolding argument\" have provided a refutation of IIT by demonstrating how\nit permits functionally identical systems to have differences in their\npredicted consciousness. The implication is that IIT and any other proposed\ntheory based on a system's causal structure may already be falsified even in\nthe absence of experimental refutation.

We argue that failing to suitably\nspecify either one can falsely suggest that the tradeoff does not hold.

We find that, for such signals and suitable\nvanishing scalings of the sparsity and sampling rate, the MMSE is nonincreasing\npiecewise constant. In specific instances the MMSE even displays an\nall-or-nothing phase transition, that is, the MMSE sharply jumps from its\nmaximum value to zero at a critical sampling rate. The all-or-nothing\nphenomenon has previously been shown to occur in high-dimensional linear\nregression. Our analysis goes beyond the linear case and applies to learning\nthe weights of a perceptron with general activation function in a\nteacher-student scenario. In particular, we discuss an all-or-nothing\nphenomenon for the generalization error with a sublinear set of training\nexamples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Jun 2020 18:29:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 27 Oct 2020 20:36:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-29", "authors_parsed": [["Luneau", "Cl\u00e9ment", ""], ["Barbier", "Jean", ""], ["Macris", "Nicolas", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.11434", "submitter": "Hussein Ammar", "authors": "Hussein A.

Moreover, the authors explain how to use such\nmechanisms for enabling IIoT networks to construct and maintain\nmultidimensional interference maps at run-time in an autonomous fashion.\nLastly, the authors give an overview of the opportunities and challenges of\nusing interference maps to enhance the performance of IIoT networks under\ninterference.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Jun 2020 11:38:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-20", "authors_parsed": [["Grimaldi", "Simone", ""], ["Mahmood", "Aamir", ""], ["Hassan", "Syed Ali", ""], ["Hancke", "Gerhard Petrus", ""], ["Gidlund", "Mikael", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.13646", "submitter": "Weiyu Chen", "authors": "Weiyu Chen, Haiyang Ding, Shilian Wang, Daniel Benevides da Costa,\n  Fengkui Gong and Pedro Henrique Juliano Nardelli", "title": "Backscatter Cooperation in NOMA Communications Systems", "comments": "31 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, a backscatter cooperation (BC) scheme is proposed for\nnon-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) downlink transmission.

Despite its\nintrinsic value for quantum computing, the widespread use of magic state\ndistillation, which is closely related to this model, emphasizes the importance\nof comprehending the hierarchy. There is currently a limited understanding of\nthe structure of this hierarchy, apart from the case of diagonal unitaries (Cui\net al., 2017; Rengaswamy et al. 2019). We explore the structure of the second\nand third levels of the hierarchy, the first level being the ubiquitous Pauli\ngroup, via the Weyl (i.e., Pauli) expansion of unitaries at these levels. In\nparticular, we characterize the support of the standard Clifford operations on\nthe Pauli group. Since conjugation of a Pauli by a third level unitary produces\ntraceless Hermitian Cliffords, we characterize their Pauli support as well.\nSemi-Clifford unitaries are known to have ancilla savings in the teleportation\nmodel, and we explore their Pauli support via symplectic transvections.\nFinally, we show that, up to multiplication by a Clifford, every third level\nunitary commutes with at least one Pauli matrix. This can be used inductively\nto show that, up to a multiplication by a Clifford, every third level unitary\nis supported on a maximal commutative subgroup of the Pauli group.\nAdditionally, it can be easily seen that the latter implies the generalized\nsemi-Clifford conjecture, proven by Beigi and Shor (2010).

These systems rely on using beamforming codebooks for both\ninitial access and data transmission. Current beam codebooks, however,\ngenerally consist of a large number of narrow beams that scan all possible\ndirections, even if these directions are never used. This leads to very large\ntraining overhead. Further, these codebooks do not normally account for the\nhardware impairments or the possible non-uniform array geometries, and their\ncalibration is an expensive process. To overcome these limitations, this paper\ndevelops an efficient online machine learning framework that learns how to\nadapt the codebook beam patterns to the specific deployment, surrounding\nenvironment, user distribution, and hardware characteristics. This is done by\ndesigning a novel complex-valued neural network architecture in which the\nneuron weights directly model the beamforming weights of the analog phase\nshifters, accounting for the key hardware constraints such as the\nconstant-modulus and quantized-angles.

The associated perceptions and actions of such habits engage\ndistributed neural circuits. Yet, precisely how such circuits support the\ncomputations necessary for habit learning remain far from understood. Here we\nconstruct a formal theory of network energetics to account for how changes in\nbrain state produce changes in sequential behavior. We exercise the theory in\nthe context of multi-unit recordings spanning the caudate nucleus, prefrontal\ncortex, and frontal eyefields of female macaque monkeys engaged in 60-180\nsessions of a free scan task that induces motor habits. The theory relies on\nthe determination of effective connectivity between recording channels, and on\nthe stipulation that a brain state is taken to be the trial-specific firing\nrate across those channels. The theory then predicts how much energy will be\nrequired to transition from one state into another, given the constraint that\nactivity can spread solely through effective connections. Consistent with the\ntheory's predictions, we observed smaller energy requirements for transitions\nbetween more similar and more complex trial saccade patterns, and for sessions\ncharacterized by less entropic selection of saccade patterns. Using a virtual\nlesioning approach, we demonstrate the resilience of the observed relationships\nbetween minimum control energy and behavior to significant disruptions in the\ninferred effective connectivity.
