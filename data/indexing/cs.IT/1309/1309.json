For IR-NTC systems based on {\\em\nfinite-length} codes (with blocklength $N$) and decoding attempts only at {\\em\ncertain specified decoding times}, this paper presents the asymptotic expansion\nachieved by random coding, provides rate-compatible sphere-packing (RCSP)\nperformance approximations, and presents simulation results of tail-biting\nconvolutional codes.\n  The information-theoretic analysis shows that values of $N$ relatively close\nto the expected latency yield the same random-coding achievability expansion as\nwith $N = \\infty$. However, the penalty introduced in the expansion by limiting\ndecoding times is linear in the interval between decoding times. For binary\nsymmetric channels, the RCSP approximation provides an efficiently-computed\napproximation of performance that shows excellent agreement with a family of\nrate-compatible, tail-biting convolutional codes in the short-latency regime.\nFor the additive white Gaussian noise channel, bounded-distance decoding\nsimplifies the computation of the marginal RCSP approximation and produces\nsimilar results as analysis based on maximum-likelihood decoding for latencies\ngreater than 200. The efficiency of the marginal RCSP approximation facilitates\noptimization of the lengths of incremental transmissions when the number of\nincremental transmissions is constrained to be small or the length of the\nincremental transmissions is constrained to be uniform after the first\ntransmission.

Besides, we take into account a minimum required power for energy\nharvesting at the idle receivers and heterogeneous quality of service (QoS)\nrequirements for the multicast video receivers. In light of the intractability\nof the problem, we reformulate the considered problem by replacing a non-convex\nprobabilistic constraint with a convex deterministic constraint. Then, a\nsemidefinite programming relaxation (SDR) approach is adopted to obtain an\nupper solution for the reformulated problem. Subsequently, sufficient\nconditions for the global optimal solution of the reformulated problem are\nrevealed. Furthermore, we propose two suboptimal power allocation schemes based\non the upper bound solution. Simulation results demonstrate the excellent\nperformance and significant transmit power savings achieved by the proposed\nschemes compared to isotropic energy signal generation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Sep 2013 12:59:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 13 Jan 2014 06:05:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 17 Jan 2014 18:54:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Ng", "Derrick Wing Kwan", ""], ["Schober", "Robert", ""], ["Alnuweiri", "Hussein", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.2238", "submitter": "Subhash Kak", "authors": "Subhash Kak", "title": "Probability and the Classical/Quantum Divide", "comments": "12 pages; 1 figure", "journal-ref": "NeuroQuantology, vol. 11, pp. 600-606, 2013", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper considers the problem of distinguishing between classical and\nquantum domains in macroscopic phenomena using tests based on probability and\nit presents a condition on the ratios of the outcomes being the same (Ps) to\nbeing different (Pn).

One particular challenge for\ninference under linear models is understanding the conditions on the dictionary\nunder which reliable inference is possible. This challenge has attracted\nrenewed attention in recent years since many modern inference problems deal\nwith the \"underdetermined\" setting, in which the number of observations is much\nsmaller than the number of columns in the dictionary. This paper makes several\ncontributions for this setting when the set of observations is given by a\nlinear combination of a small number of groups of columns of the dictionary,\ntermed the \"block-sparse\" case. First, it specifies conditions on the\ndictionary under which most block subdictionaries are well conditioned. This\nresult is fundamentally different from prior work on block-sparse inference\nbecause (i) it provides conditions that can be explicitly computed in\npolynomial time, (ii) the given conditions translate into near-optimal scaling\nof the number of columns of the block subdictionaries as a function of the\nnumber of observations for a large class of dictionaries, and (iii) it suggests\nthat the spectral norm and the quadratic-mean block coherence of the dictionary\n(rather than the worst-case coherences) fundamentally limit the scaling of\ndimensions of the well-conditioned block subdictionaries. Second, this paper\ninvestigates the problems of block-sparse recovery and block-sparse regression\nin underdetermined settings. Near-optimal block-sparse recovery and regression\nare possible for certain dictionaries as long as the dictionary satisfies\neasily computable conditions and the coefficients describing the linear\ncombination of groups of columns can be modeled through a mild statistical\nprior.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Sep 2013 16:21:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 14 Dec 2014 01:39:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 28 Apr 2015 16:56:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 28 Aug 2016 20:15:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-06", "authors_parsed": [["Bajwa", "Waheed U.", ""], ["Duarte", "Marco F.", ""], ["Calderbank", "Robert", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.5396", "submitter": "Jun Geng", "authors": "Jun Geng, Erhan Bayraktar and Lifeng Lai", "title": "Bayesian Quickest Change Point Detection with Sampling Right Constraints", "comments": "18 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, Bayesian quickest change detection problems with sampling\nright constraints are considered. Specifically, there is a sequence of random\nvariables whose probability density function will change at an unknown time.\nThe goal is to detect this change in a way such that a linear combination of\nthe average detection delay and the false alarm probability is minimized. Two\ntypes of sampling right constrains are discussed. The first one is a limited\nsampling right constraint, in which the observer can take at most $N$\nobservations from this random sequence. Under this setup, we show that the cost\nfunction can be written as a set of iterative functions, which can be solved by\nMarkov optimal stopping theory. The optimal stopping rule is shown to be a\nthreshold rule. An asymptotic upper bound of the average detection delay is\ndeveloped as the false alarm probability goes to zero. This upper bound\nindicates that the performance of the limited sampling right problem is close\nto that of the classic Bayesian quickest detection for several scenarios of\npractical interest. The second constraint discussed in this paper is a\nstochastic sampling right constraint, in which sampling rights are consumed by\ntaking observations and are replenished randomly. The observer cannot take\nobservations if there are no sampling rights left. We characterize the optimal\nsolution, which has a very complex structure. For practical applications, we\npropose a low complexity algorithm, in which the sampling rule is to take\nobservations as long as the observer has sampling rights left and the detection\nscheme is a threshold rule.

Due to such network\ndensification and the intense proliferation of wireless devices, modern\nwireless networks are interference-limited, which motivates the use of\ninterference mitigation and coordination techniques. In this work, we develop a\nstatistical framework to evaluate the performance of multi-tier heterogeneous\nnetworks with successive interference cancellation (SIC) capabilities,\naccounting for the computational complexity of the cancellation scheme and\nrelevant network related parameters such as random location of the access\npoints (APs) and mobile users, and the characteristics of the wireless\npropagation channel. We explicitly model the consecutive events of canceling\ninterferers and we derive the success probability to cancel the n-th strongest\nsignal and to decode the signal of interest after n cancellations. When users\nare connected to the AP which provides the maximum average received signal\npower, the analysis indicates that the performance gains of SIC diminish\nquickly with n and the benefits are modest for realistic values of the\nsignal-to-interference ratio (SIR). We extend the statistical model to include\nseveral association policies where distinct gains of SIC are expected: (i)\nminimum load association, (ii) maxi- mum instantaneous SIR association, and\n(iii) range expansion. Numerical results show the effectiveness of SIC for the\nconsidered association policies.

In closed-loop training, the user\nfeeds back the best training signal to be sent in the future based on channel\nprediction and the previously received training signals.

A variety of examples are considered including the\ndensity-evolution equations for: irregular LDPC codes on the BEC, irregular\nlow-density generator matrix codes on the BEC, a class of generalized LDPC\ncodes with BCH component codes, the joint iterative decoding of LDPC codes on\nintersymbol-interference channels with erasure noise, and the compressed\nsensing of random vectors with i.i.d. components.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Sep 2013 16:29:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 Oct 2013 04:38:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 11 Sep 2014 13:49:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Yedla", "Arvind", ""], ["Jian", "Yung-Yih", ""], ["Nguyen", "Phong S.", ""], ["Pfister", "Henry D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.7964", "submitter": "Anelia Somekh-Baruch", "authors": "Anelia Somekh-Baruch", "title": "A General Formula for the Mismatch Capacity", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The fundamental limits of channels with mismatched decoding are addressed. A\ngeneral formula is established for the mismatch capacity of a general channel,\ndefined as a sequence of conditional distributions with a general decoding\nmetrics sequence. We deduce an identity between the Verd\\'{u}-Han general\nchannel capacity formula, and the mismatch capacity formula applied to Maximum\nLikelihood decoding metric. Further, several upper bounds on the capacity are\nprovided, and a simpler expression for a lower bound is derived for the case of\na non-negative decoding metric. The general formula is specialized to the case\nof finite input and output alphabet channels with a type-dependent metric. The\nclosely related problem of threshold mismatched decoding is also studied, and a\ngeneral expression for the threshold mismatch capacity is obtained. As an\nexample of threshold mismatch capacity, we state a general expression for the\nerasures-only capacity of the finite input and output alphabet channel. We\nobserve that for every channel there exists a (matched) threshold decoder which\nis capacity achieving. Additionally, necessary and sufficient conditions are\nstated for a channel to have a strong converse. Csisz\\'{a}r and Narayan's\nconjecture is proved for bounded metrics, providing a positive answer to the\nopen problem introduced in [1], i.e., that the \"product-space\" improvement of\nthe lower random coding bound, $C_q^{(\\infty)}(W)$, is indeed the mismatch\ncapacity of the discrete memoryless channel $W$. We conclude by presenting an\nidentity between the threshold capacity and $C_q^{(\\infty)}(W)$ in the DMC\ncase.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Sep 2013 19:09:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Somekh-Baruch", "Anelia", ""]]}]
