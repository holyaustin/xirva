Numerical simulations\nsuggest that the algorithm outperforms uniform matrix completion in a broad\nclass of matrices, and in particular, is much less sensitive to the condition\nnumber than our theory currently requires.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Sep 2016 01:25:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 25 Jun 2017 14:45:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 17 Nov 2017 21:44:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-21", "authors_parsed": [["Eftekhari", "Armin", ""], ["Wakin", "Michael B.", ""], ["Ward", "Rachel A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.01797", "submitter": "Christoph Studer", "authors": "Oscar Casta\\~neda, Tom Goldstein, Christoph Studer", "title": "Data Detection in Large Multi-Antenna Wireless Systems via Approximate\n  Semidefinite Relaxation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers (TCAS\n  I), Vol. 63, No. 12, Dec. 2016", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Practical data detectors for future wireless systems with hundreds of\nantennas at the base station must achieve high throughput and low error rate at\nlow complexity.

Using a discrete\ncodebook consisting of multiple analog beams, each beam focuses on a certain\nrange of angles of arrival or departure and corresponds to a set of fixed phase\nshifts across frequency due to practical hardware considerations. However, for\nsufficiently large bandwidth, the gain provided by the phased array is actually\nfrequency dependent, which is an effect called beam squint, and this effect\noccurs even if the radiation pattern of the antenna elements is frequency\nindependent. This paper examines the nature of beam squint for a uniform linear\narray (ULA) and analyzes its impact on codebook design as a function of the\nnumber of antennas and system bandwidth normalized by the carrier frequency.\nThe criterion for codebook design is to guarantee that each beam's minimum gain\nfor a range of angles and for all frequencies in the wideband system exceeds a\ntarget threshold, for example 3 dB below the array's maximum gain. Analysis and\nnumerical examples suggest that a denser codebook is required to compensate for\nbeam squint. For example, 54% more beams are needed compared to a codebook\ndesign that ignores beam squint for a ULA with 32 antennas operating at a\ncarrier frequency of 73 GHz and bandwidth of 2.5 GHz. Furthermore, beam squint\nwith this design criterion limits the bandwidth or the number of antennas of\nthe array if the other one is fixed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 11 Sep 2016 13:32:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 22 Sep 2016 17:58:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-23", "authors_parsed": [["Cai", "Mingming", ""], ["Gao", "Kang", ""], ["Nie", "Ding", ""], ["Hochwald", "Bertrand", ""], ["Laneman", "J.

Beamforming, which has been proved to have many advantages, can also be\napplied to enhance the wireless security.\n  One of the most common threats, i.e., passive eavesdropping, is addressed in\nthis thesis. To reduce the risk of leaking information to the eavesdroppers,\nthe physical region where the transmission is exposed to eavesdropping has been\nstudied. In this thesis, the exposure region based beamforming technique is\nproposed to combat the threat from the randomly located eavesdroppers in a\nfading channel. In this system model, the large-scale path loss and a general\nRician fading channel model are considered. The exposure region is established\nto describe the secrecy performance of the system, based on which the\nprobability that the secrecy outage event occurs is defined to evaluate the\nsecurity level of the exposure region.\n  The antenna array is one of the most important factors that affect the\nsecrecy performance of the exposure region based beamforming technique. The\npotential of using different array geometry and array configuration to improve\nsecurity is explored.

We analyze its role in the thermodynamic functioning of\ninformation ratchets---a form of autonomous Maxwellian Demon capable of\nexploiting fluctuations in an external information reservoir to harvest useful\nwork from a thermal bath. This establishes a quantitative paradigm for\nunderstanding how adaptive agents leverage structured thermal environments for\ntheir own thermodynamic benefit. General ratchets behave as memoryful\ncommunication channels, interacting with their environment sequentially and\nstoring results to an output. The bulk of thermal ratchets analyzed to date,\nhowever, assume memoryless environments that generate input signals without\ntemporal correlations. Employing computational mechanics and a new\ninformation-processing Second Law of Thermodynamics (IPSL) we remove these\nrestrictions, analyzing general finite-state ratchets interacting with\nstructured environments that generate correlated input signals. On the one\nhand, we demonstrate that a ratchet need not have memory to exploit an\nuncorrelated environment. On the other, and more appropriate to biological\nadaptation, we show that a ratchet must have memory to most effectively\nleverage structure and correlation in its environment. The lesson is that to\noptimally harvest work a ratchet's memory must reflect the input generator's\nmemory. Finally, we investigate achieving the IPSL bounds on the amount of work\na ratchet can extract from its environment, discovering that finite-state,\noptimal ratchets are unable to reach these bounds. In contrast, we show that\ninfinite-state ratchets can go well beyond these bounds by utilizing their own\ninfinite \"negentropy\".

It is compatible with any arbitrary type of\nwavelet frame defined on the sphere, such as axisymmetric wavelets, directional\nwavelets, curvelets, and hybrid wavelet constructions. Such an approach allows\nthe desirable properties of wavelets to be naturally inherited in the\nsegmentation process.

The aim is to\ndesign schemes that minimise communication between the user and the servers.\nMore recently, there have been moves to consider more realistic models where\nthe total storage of the set of servers, or the per server storage, should be\nminimised (possibly using techniques from distributed storage), and where the\ndatabase is divided into $R$-bit records with $R>1$, and the user wishes to\nretrieve one record rather than one bit.

Instead, we propose bit-permuted coded modulation (BPCM): a\ntechnique for using the multilevel coding (MLC) approach for an arbitrary polar\ncode. The BPCM technique exploits a natural connection between MLC and polar\ncodes. It involves applying bit permutations prior to mapping the polar code to\na higher order modulation. The bit permutations are designed, via density\nevolution, to match the rates provided by various bit levels of the higher\norder modulation to that of the polar code.\n  We demonstrate performance of the BPCM technique using link simulations and\ndensity evolution for the AWGN channel. We compare the BPCM technique with the\nbit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) technique. When using polar codes\ndesigned for BPSK modulation, we show gains for BPCM over BICM with random\ninterleaver of up to 0.2 dB, 0.7 dB and 1.4 dB for 4-ASK, 8-ASK, and 16-ASK\nrespectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Sep 2016 15:53:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Tavildar", "Saurabha R", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.09823", "submitter": "Ravi  Tandon", "authors": "Mohamed Attia and Ravi Tandon", "title": "On the Worst-case Communication Overhead for Distributed Data Shuffling", "comments": "To appear in Allerton 2016", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.DC cs.LG math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Distributed learning platforms for processing large scale data-sets are\nbecoming increasingly prevalent.

At each iteration over the data, it is common practice to\nrandomly re-shuffle the data at the master node, assigning different batches\nfor each worker to process.
