For example one would not use smartphone\ncameras for high quality phase-metrology, because of their lower (S/N) images.\nHowever smartphones digitize high-resolution (12 megapixel) images, and as we\nshow here, the information storage of an image depends on its bandwidth and its\n(S/N). The standard formalism for measuring information are the Shannon-entropy\nH, and the Shannon capacity theorem (SCT). According to SCT, low (S/N) images\nmay be compensated with a larger fringe-bandwidth to obtain high-information\nphase measurements. So broad bandwidth fringes may give high quality phase, in\nspite of digitizing low (S/N) fringe images. Most real-life images are\nredundant, they have smooth zones where the pixel-value do not change much, and\ndata compression algorithms are paramount for image transmission/storage.\nShannon's capacity theorem is used to gauge competing image compression\nalgorithms.

Motivated by the geographic feature in\nindustrial automation that in the factories many tasks are assigned to\ndifferent groups of devices who work in close proximity to each other and thus\ncan form clusters of reliable device-to-device (D2D) networks, this paper\nproposes a novel two-phase transmission protocol for achieving the above goal.\nSpecifically, in the first phase within the latency requirement, the\nmulti-antenna base station (BS) combines the messages of each group together\nand multicasts them to the corresponding groups; while in the second phase, the\ndevices that have decoded the messages successfully, who are defined as the\nleaders, help relay the messages to the other devices in their groups. Under\nthis protocol, we further design an innovative leader selection based\nbeamforming strategy at the BS by utilizing the sparse optimization technique,\nwhich leads to the desired sparsity pattern in user activity, i.e., at least\none leader exists in each group, in the first phase, thus making full\nutilization of the reliable D2D networks in the second phase.

In realistic scenarios involving\nclustered storage structures, repairing storage nodes using intact nodes\nresiding in other clusters is more bandwidth-consuming than restoring nodes\nbased on information from intra-cluster nodes. Therefore, it is important to\ndifferentiate between intra-cluster repair bandwidth and cross-cluster repair\nbandwidth in modeling distributed storage. Capacity of the suggested model is\nobtained as a function of fundamental resources of distributed storage systems,\nnamely, node storage capacity, intra-cluster repair bandwidth and cross-cluster\nrepair bandwidth.

This paper addresses the issue of physical-layer security in a UAV\ncommunication system, where a UAV sends confidential information to a\nlegitimate receiver in the presence of a potential eavesdropper which are both\non the ground. We aim to maximize the secrecy rate of the system by jointly\noptimizing the UAV's trajectory and transmit power over a finite horizon. In\ncontrast to the existing literature on wireless security with static nodes, we\nexploit the mobility of the UAV in this paper to enhance the secrecy rate via a\nnew trajectory design. Although the formulated problem is non-convex and\nchallenging to solve, we propose an iterative algorithm to solve the problem\nefficiently, based on the block coordinate descent and successive convex\noptimization methods. Specifically, the UAV's transmit power and trajectory are\neach optimized with the other fixed in an alternating manner until convergence.\nNumerical results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the\nsecrecy rate of the UAV communication system, as compared to benchmark schemes\nwithout transmit power control or trajectory optimization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Oct 2017 07:24:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-13", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Guangchi", ""], ["Wu", "Qingqing", ""], ["Cui", "Miao", ""], ["Zhang", "Rui", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.04521", "submitter": "Jefrey Lijffijt", "authors": "Jefrey Lijffijt, Bo Kang, Wouter Duivesteijn, Kai Puolam\\\"aki, Emilia\n  Oikarinen, Tijl De Bie", "title": "Subjectively Interesting Subgroup Discovery on Real-valued Targets", "comments": "12 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables, conference submission", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ML cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Deriving insights from high-dimensional data is one of the core problems in\ndata mining.

One common solution to these problems is to deploy monitors to detect\nmisbehaviors on certain channel. However, in multi-channel CRNs, it is very\ncostly to deploy monitors on every channel. With a limited number of monitors,\nwe have to decide which channels to monitor. In addition, we need to determine\nhow long to monitor each channel and in which order to monitor, because\nswitching channels incurs costs.

To answer those questions, we model the\nspectrum monitoring problem as an adversarial multi-armed bandit problem with\nswitching costs (MAB-SC), propose an effective framework, and design two online\nalgorithms, SpecWatch-II and SpecWatch-III, based on the same framework.

Our main objective is to reduce the large\noverhead incurred by Downlink (DL) common training and Uplink (UL) feedback\nneeded to obtain channel state information (CSI) at the base station. Our\nproposed scheme relies on the fact that the underlying angular distribution of\na channel vector, also known as the angular scattering function, is a\nfrequency-invariant entity yielding a UL-DL reciprocity and has a limited\nangular support. We estimate this support from UL CSI and interpolate it to\nobtain the corresponding angular support of the DL channel. Finally we exploit\nthe estimated support of the DL channel of all the users to design an efficient\nchannel probing and feedback scheme that maximizes the total spectral\nefficiency of the system. Our method is different from the existing\ncompressed-sensing (CS) based techniques in the literature. Using support\ninformation helps reduce the feedback overhead from O(s*log M) in CS techniques\nto O(s) in our proposed method, with $s$ and $M$ being sparsity order of the\nchannel vectors and the number of base station antennas, respectively.\nFurthermore, in order to control the channel sparsity and therefore the DL\ncommon training and UL feedback overhead, we introduce the novel concept of\nactive channel sparsification. In brief, when the fixed pilot dimension is less\nthan the required amount for reliable channel estimation, we introduce a\npre-beamforming matrix that artificially reduces the effective channel\ndimension of each user to be not larger than the DL pilot dimension, while\nmaximizing both the number of served users and the number of probed angles.

Under GAP, learning the privacy mechanism is\nformulated as a constrained minimax game between two players: a privatizer that\nsanitizes the dataset in a way that limits the risk of inference attacks on the\nindividuals' private variables, and an adversary that tries to infer the\nprivate variables from the sanitized dataset. To evaluate GAP's performance, we\ninvestigate two simple (yet canonical) statistical dataset models: (a) the\nbinary data model, and (b) the binary Gaussian mixture model. For both models,\nwe derive game-theoretically optimal minimax privacy mechanisms, and show that\nthe privacy mechanisms learned from data (in a generative adversarial fashion)\nmatch the theoretically optimal ones.

First we define a kind of innovation corresponding to the received data,\ni.e., the input to a Viterbi decoder. Then the structure of a\nScarce-State-Transition (SST) Viterbi decoder is derived in a natural manner.\nIt is shown that the newly defined innovation is just the input to the main\ndecoder in an SST Viterbi decoder and generates the same syndrome as the\noriginal received data does. A similar result holds for Quick-Look-In (QLI)\ncodes as well. In this case, however, the precise innovation is not defined. We\nsee that this innovation-like quantity is related to the linear smoothed\nestimate of the information. The essence of innovations approach to a linear\nfiltering problem is first to whiten the observed data, and then to treat the\nresulting simpler white-noise observations problem. In our case, this\ncorresponds to the reduction of decoding complexity in the main decoder in an\nSST Viterbi decoder. We show the distributions related to the main decoder\n(i.e., the input distribution and the state distribution in the code trellis\nfor the main decoder) are much biased under moderately noisy conditions. We see\nthat these biased distributions actually lead to the complexity reduction in\nthe main decoder.
