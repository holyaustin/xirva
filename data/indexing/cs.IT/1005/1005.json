An important conclusion\nof this paper is that the lower and upper bounds of the sum capacity for\nsmall/medium size CDMA systems depend on both the input and the signature\nsymbols; this is contrary to the asymptotic results for large scale systems\nreported in the literature (also confirmed in this paper) where the signature\nsymbols and statistics disappear in the asymptotic sum capacity. Moreover,\nthese questions are investigated for the case when not all users are active.\nFurthermore, upper and asymptotic bounds are derived and numerically evaluated\nand compared to other derivations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 May 2010 06:52:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Alishahi", "K.", ""], ["Dashmiz", "S.", ""], ["Pad", "P.", ""], ["Marvasti", "F.", ""], ["Shafinia", "M.

The relay nodes receive\nthe sum signal from S1 and S2 in the first time slot. In the second time slot,\neach relay node multiplies its received signal by a complex coefficient and\nretransmits the signal to the two source nodes, which leads to a distributed\ntwo-way beamforming system. By applying the principle of analog network coding,\neach receiver at S1 and S2 cancels the ``self-interference'' in the received\nsignal from the relay cluster and decodes the message. This paper studies the\n2-dimensional achievable rate region for such a two-way relay network with\ndistributed beamforming. With different assumptions of channel reciprocity\nbetween the source-relay and relay-source channels, the achievable rate region\nis characterized under two setups. First, with reciprocal channels, we\ninvestigate the achievable rate regions when the relay cluster is subject to a\nsum-power constraint or individual-power constraints. We show that the optimal\nbeamforming vectors obtained from solving the weighted sum inverse-SNR\nminimization (WSISMin) problems are sufficient to characterize the\ncorresponding achievable rate region. Furthermore, we derive the closed form\nsolutions for those optimal beamforming vectors and consequently propose the\npartially distributed algorithms to implement the optimal beamforming, where\neach relay node only needs the local channel information and one global\nparameter. Second, with the non-reciprocal channels, the achievable rate\nregions are also characterized for both the sum-power constraint case and the\nindividual-power constraint case.

Central to the idea of typicality is that a sequence $x_1, x_2,\n..., x_n$ that is $P_X$-typical should, loosely speaking, have an empirical\ndistribution that is in some sense close to the distribution $P_X$. The two\nmost common notions of typicality are that of strong (letter) typicality and\nweak (entropy) typicality. While weak typicality allows one to apply many\narguments that can be made with strongly typical arguments, some arguments for\nstrong typicality cannot be generalized to weak typicality. In this paper, we\nconsider an alternate definition of typicality, namely one based on the weak*\ntopology and that is applicable to Polish alphabets (which includes\n$\\reals^n$). This notion is a generalization of strong typicality in the sense\nthat it degenerates to strong typicality in the finite alphabet case, and can\nalso be applied to mixed and continuous distributions. Furthermore, it is\nstrong enough to prove a Markov lemma, and thus can be used to directly prove a\nmore general class of results than weak typicality. As an example of this\ntechnique, we directly prove achievability for Gel'fand-Pinsker channels with\ninput constraints for a large class of alphabets and channels without first\nproving a finite alphabet result and then resorting to delicate quantization\narguments.

The\nsource first transmits locally. The cooperating nodes that receive the source\nsignal retransmit a weighted version of it in an amplify-and-forward (AF)\nfashion. Assuming knowledge of the second-order statistics of the channel state\ninformation, beamforming weights are determined so that the signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) at the destination is maximized subject to two different power\nconstraints, i.e., a total (source and relay) power constraint, and individual\nrelay power constraints. For the former constraint, the original problem is\ntransformed into a problem of one variable, which can be solved via Newton's\nmethod. For the latter constraint, the original problem is transformed into a\nhomogeneous quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem. In\nthis case, it is shown that when the number of relays does not exceed three the\nglobal solution can always be constructed via semidefinite programming (SDP)\nrelaxation and the matrix rank-one decomposition technique. For the cases in\nwhich the SDP relaxation does not generate a rank one solution, two methods are\nproposed to solve the problem: the first one is based on the coordinate descent\nmethod, and the second one transforms the QCQP problem into an infinity norm\nmaximization problem in which a smooth finite norm approximation can lead to\nthe solution using the augmented Lagrangian method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 May 2010 22:37:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-28", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Jiangyuan", ""], ["Petropulu", "Athina P.", ""], ["Poor", "H.
