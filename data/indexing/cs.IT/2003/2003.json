As modern processing is\ndigital, it operates on sampled versions of the CT signals. When sampling is\napplied to a CT WSCS process, the statistics of the resulting discrete-time\n(DT) process depends on the relationship between the sampling interval and the\nperiod of the statistics of the CT process: When these two parameters have a\ncommon integer factor, then the DT process is WSCS.

In this work, we study the fundamental tradeoff of\nsources codes applied to sampled CT WSCS processes, namely, their\nrate-distortion function (RDF). We note that RDF characterization for the case\nof synchronous sampling directly follows from classic information-theoretic\ntools utilizing ergodicity and the law of large numbers; however, when sampling\nis asynchronous, the resulting process is not information stable. In such\ncases, commonly used information-theoretic tools are inapplicable to RDF\nanalysis, which poses a major challenge. Using the information spectrum\nframework, we show that the RDF for asynchronous sampling in the low distortion\nregime can be expressed as the limit superior of a sequence of RDFs in which\neach element corresponds to the RDF of a synchronously sampled WSCS process\n(but their limit is not guaranteed to exist). The resulting characterization\nallows us to introduce novel insights on the relationship between sampling\nsynchronization and RDF.

Using this map, we derive an explicit construction of the quantum\ncircuit of a joint-detection receiver based on a recent idea of\n\"belief-propagation with quantum messages\" (BPQM) (arXiv:1607.04833). We\nquantify its performance improvement over the Dolinar receiver that performs\noptimal pulse-by-pulse detection, which represents the best \"classical\"\napproach. We analyze the scheme rigorously and show that it achieves the\nquantum limit of minimum average error probability in discriminating 8 (BPSK)\ncodewords of a length-5 binary linear code with a tree factor graph. Our result\nsuggests that a BPQM-receiver might attain the Holevo capacity of this\nBPSK-modulated pure-loss channel. Moreover, our receiver circuit provides an\nalternative proposal for a quantum supremacy experiment, targeted at a specific\napplication that can potentially be implemented on a small, special-purpose,\nphotonic quantum computer capable of performing cat-basis universal qubit\nlogic.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Mar 2020 18:44:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 7 May 2021 16:52:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-10", "authors_parsed": [["Rengaswamy", "Narayanan", ""], ["Seshadreesan", "Kaushik P.", ""], ["Guha", "Saikat", ""], ["Pfister", "Henry D.", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.04421", "submitter": "Roman Sokolovskii", "authors": "Roman Sokolovskii and Alexandre Graell i Amat and Fredrik\n  Br\\\"annstr\\\"om", "title": "Finite-Length Scaling of Spatially Coupled LDPC Codes Under Window\n  Decoding Over the BEC", "comments": "Published in IEEE Transactions on Communications (Early Access).

In\nthis paper, we consider the framework of partitioned edge learning for\niteratively training a large-scale model using many resource-constrained\ndevices (called workers).

To reduce resource\nusage by minimizing the total learning-and-communication latency, this work\nfocuses on the novel joint design of parameter (computation load) allocation\nand bandwidth allocation (for downloading and uploading). Two design approaches\nare adopted. First, a practical sequential approach, called partially\nintegrated parameter-and-bandwidth allocation (PABA), yields two schemes,\nnamely bandwidth aware parameter allocation and parameter aware bandwidth\nallocation. The former minimizes the load for the slowest (in computing) of\nworker groups, each training a same parametric block. The latter allocates the\nlargest bandwidth to the worker being the latency bottleneck. Second, PABA are\njointly optimized. Despite its being a nonconvex problem, an efficient and\noptimal solution algorithm is derived by intelligently nesting a bisection\nsearch and solving a convex problem.

In a frequency division duplex (FDD)\nmultiuser massive MIMO network, each user needs to compress and feedback its\ndownlink CSI to the BS. The CSI overhead scales with the number of antennas,\nusers and subcarriers, and becomes a major bottleneck for the overall spectral\nefficiency. In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based CSI\ncompression scheme, called DeepCMC, composed of convolutional layers followed\nby quantization and entropy coding blocks. In comparison with previous DL-based\nCSI reduction structures, DeepCMC proposes a novel fully-convolutional neural\nnetwork (NN) architecture, with residual layers at the decoder, and\nincorporates quantization and entropy coding blocks into its design. DeepCMC is\ntrained to minimize a weighted rate-distortion cost, which enables a trade-off\nbetween the CSI quality and its feedback overhead. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that DeepCMC outperforms the state of the art CSI compression\nschemes in terms of the reconstruction quality of CSI for the same compression\nrate. We also propose a distributed version of DeepCMC for a multi-user MIMO\nscenario to encode and reconstruct the CSI from multiple users in a distributed\nmanner.

The first one concerns a\npoint set $S$ of size $q+1$ in the classical projective plane $PG(2,q)$, where\nthe intersection distribution of $S$ indicates the intersection pattern between\n$S$ and the lines in $PG(2,q)$. The second one relates to a polynomial $f$ over\na finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, where the intersection distribution of $f$\nrecords an overall distribution property of a collection of polynomials\n$\\{f(x)+cx \\mid c \\in \\mathbb{F}_q\\}$. These two perspectives are closely\nrelated, in the sense that each polynomial produces a $(q+1)$-set in a\ncanonical way and conversely, each $(q+1)$-set with certain property has a\npolynomial representation. Indeed, the intersection distribution provides a new\nangle to distinguish polynomials over finite fields, based on the geometric\nproperty of the corresponding $(q+1)$-sets. Among the intersection\ndistribution, we identify a particularly interesting quantity named non-hitting\nindex. For a point set $S$, its non-hitting index counts the number of lines in\n$PG(2,q)$ which do not hit $S$.

The relationship is calculated using\nconditional geometric mutual information which evaluates the amount of similar\ninformation exchanged between the filters using a graph-based criterion. When\npruning a network, we ensure that retained filters contribute the majority of\nthe information towards succeeding layers which ensures high performance. Our\nnovel approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art compression-via-pruning\nmethods on the standard benchmarks for this task: MNIST, CIFAR-10, and\nILSVRC2012, across a variety of network architectures. In addition, we discuss\nour observations of a common denominator between our pruning methodology's\nresponse to adversarial attacks and calibration statistics when compared to the\noriginal network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 Mar 2020 21:05:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Ganesh", "Madan Ravi", ""], ["Corso", "Jason J.", ""], ["Sekeh", "Salimeh Yasaei", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.08473", "submitter": "Nikolaos Thomos", "authors": "Pantelis Maniotis and Nikolaos Thomos", "title": "Viewport-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for 360$^o$ Video\n  Caching", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MM cs.IT cs.LG cs.NI math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  360$^o$ video is an essential component of VR/AR/MR systems that provides\nimmersive experience to the users.

To solve\nthe problem, we first formulate the content placement of 360$^o$ videos in edge\ncache networks as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and then we determine the\noptimal caching placement using the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm.

The proposed SVM-based FL method enables each\nHAB to cooperatively build an SVM model that can determine all user\nassociations without any transmissions of either user historical associations\nor computational tasks to other HABs. Given the prediction of the optimal user\nassociation, the service sequence and task allocation of each user can be\noptimized so as to minimize the weighted sum of the energy and time\nconsumption. Simulations with real data of city cellular traffic from the\nOMNILab at Shanghai Jiao Tong University show that the proposed algorithm can\nreduce the weighted sum of the energy and time consumption of all users by up\nto 16.1% compared to a conventional centralized method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Mar 2020 14:18:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-23", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Sihua", ""], ["Chen", "Mingzhe", ""], ["Yin", "Changchuan", ""], ["Saad", "Walid", ""], ["Hong", "Choong Seon", ""], ["Cui", "Shuguang", ""], ["Poor", "H.

Content clients can\nretrieve a requested content from the nearest content provider in their\nproximity (cluster), or, as a last resort, the base station (BS). The developed\nspatiotemporal model is leveraged to formulate a joint optimization problem of\nthe content caching and spectrum partitioning in order to minimize the average\nservice delay. Due to the high complexity of the optimization problem, the\ncaching and spectrum partitioning problems are decoupled and solved iteratively\nusing the block coordinate descent (BCD) optimization technique. To this end,\nan optimal and suboptimal solutions are obtained for the bandwidth partitioning\nand probabilistic caching subproblems, respectively. Numerical results\nhighlight the superiority of the proposed scheme over conventional caching\nschemes under equal and optimized bandwidth allocations. Particularly, it is\nshown that the average service delay is reduced by nearly 100% and 350%,\ncompared to the Zipf and uniform caching schemes under equal bandwidth\nallocations, respectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Mar 2020 12:53:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-25", "authors_parsed": [["Amer", "Ramy", ""], ["Elsawy", "Hesham", ""], ["Butt", "M.

In addition, we survey\nseveral improved rates via multi-user coding techniques, as well as recent\ndevelopments and challenges in establishing upper bounds on the mismatch\ncapacity, and an analogous mismatched encoding problem in rate-distortion\ntheory. Throughout the monograph, we highlight a variety of applications and\nconnections with other prominent information theory problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 01:12:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 18 Jun 2020 06:45:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 8 Sep 2020 05:21:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-09", "authors_parsed": [["Scarlett", "Jonathan", ""], ["F\u00e0bregas", "Albert Guill\u00e9n i", ""], ["Somekh-Baruch", "Anelia", ""], ["Martinez", "Alfonso", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.11720", "submitter": "Wen Chen", "authors": "Qingqing Wu, Guangchi Zhang, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng, Wen Chen, and\n  Robert Schober", "title": "Generalized Wireless-Powered Communications: When to Activate Wireless\n  Power Transfer?", "comments": "TVT", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT eess.SP math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Wireless-powered communication network (WPCN) is a key technology to power\nenergy-limited massive devices, such as on-board wireless sensors in autonomous\nvehicles, for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. Conventional WPCNs rely\nonly on dedicated downlink wireless power transfer (WPT), which is practically\ninefficient due to the significant energy loss in wireless signal propagation.\nMeanwhile, ambient energy harvesting is highly appealing as devices can\nscavenge energy from various existing energy sources (e.g., solar energy and\ncellular signals). Unfortunately, the randomness of the availability of these\nenergy sources cannot guarantee stable communication services. Motivated by the\nabove, we consider a generalized WPCN where the devices can not only harvest\nenergy from a dedicated multiple-antenna power station (PS), but can also\nexploit stored energy stemming from ambient energy harvesting. Since the\ndedicated WPT consumes system resources, if the stored energy is sufficient,\nWPT may not be needed to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR). To analytically\ncharacterize this phenomenon, we derive the condition for WPT activation and\nreveal how it is affected by the different system parameters. Subsequently, we\nfurther derive the optimal resource allocation policy for the cases that WPT is\nactivated and deactivated, respectively. In particular, it is found that when\nWPT is activated, the optimal energy beamforming at the PS does not depend on\nthe devices' stored energy, which is shown to lead to a new unfairness issue.\nSimulation results verify our theoretical findings and demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed optimal resource allocation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 03:05:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-27", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Qingqing", ""], ["Zhang", "Guangchi", ""], ["Ng", "Derrick Wing Kwan", ""], ["Chen", "Wen", ""], ["Schober", "Robert", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.11722", "submitter": "Masahito Hayashi", "authors": "Masahito Hayashi, Masaki Owari, Go Kato, and Ning Cai", "title": "Reduction Theorem for Secrecy over Linear Network Code for Active\n  Attacks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.3390/e22091053", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We discuss the effect of sequential error injection on information leakage\nunder a network code.

Embedding with the proposed structure, an efficient\nclassification model that accepts multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) as input\nis constructed. Methods: One-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNN)\nhave proven to be effective in pervasive classification tasks, enabling the\nautomatic extraction of features while classifying targets. We implement the\nResidual connection and design a structure which can learn the weights from the\ninformation contained in different channels in the input feature map during the\ntraining process. An indicator named mean square deviation is introduced to\nmonitor the performance of a particular model segment in the classification\ntask on the two out of the five ECG classes. The data in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia\ndatabase is used and a series of control experiments is conducted. Results:\nUtilizing both leads of the ECG signals as input to the neural network\nclassifier can achieve better classification results than those from using\nsingle channel inputs in different application scenarios. Models embedded with\nthe channel-wise attention structure always achieve better scores on\nsensitivity and precision than the plain Resnet models. The proposed model\nexceeds the performance of most of the state-of-the-art models in ventricular\nectopic beats (VEB) classification, and achieves competitive scores for\nsupraventricular ectopic beats (SVEB). Conclusion: Adopting more lead ECG\nsignals as input can increase the dimensions of the input feature maps, helping\nto improve both the performance and generalization of the network model.\nSignificance: Due to its end-to-end characteristics, and the extensible\nintrinsic for multi-lead heart diseases diagnosing, the proposed model can be\nused for the real-time ECG tracking of ECG waveforms for Holter or wearable\ndevices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Mar 2020 02:28:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-27", "authors_parsed": [["Tung", "Hao", ""], ["Zheng", "Chao", ""], ["Mao", "Xinsheng", ""], ["Qian", "Dahong", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.12034", "submitter": "Arsenia (Ersi) Chorti", "authors": "Miroslav Mitev, Arsenia Chorti, E.

To this aim, two fundamental properties are used: a signal\nsample represents a linear combination of the sparse coefficients, whereas the\ndisturbance degrade original signal sparsity. The properly selected samples are\nfurther used as measurements in the sparse signal reconstruction, performed\nusing algorithms from the compressive sensing framework.

Under a long-term\npower constraint, the computation server switches from one state to another in\nsequence: first a deterministic $T_o$ time units in OFF state, then waiting for\na job arrival in ON-Idle state and then in ON-Busy state for an independent\nidentically distributed compute time duration. The transmission server has a\nsingle unit data buffer to save incoming packets and applies last come first\nserve with discarding as well as a packet deadline to discard a sitting packet\nfor maintaining information freshness, which is measured by the Age of\nInformation (AoI). Additionally, there is a monotonic functional relation\nbetween the mean time spent in ON-Busy state and the mean transmission time. We\nobtain closed-form expressions for average AoI and average peak AoI.

In semantic PIR, a user retrieves a message out of $K$\nindependent messages stored in $N$ replicated and non-colluding databases\nwithout revealing the identity of the desired message to any individual\ndatabase. The messages come with \\emph{different semantics}, i.e., the messages\nare allowed to have \\emph{non-uniform a priori probabilities} denoted by\n$(p_i>0,\\: i \\in [K])$, which are a proxy for their respective popularity of\nretrieval, and \\emph{arbitrary message sizes} $(L_i,\\: i \\in [K])$. This is a\ngeneralization of the classical private information retrieval (PIR) problem,\nwhere messages are assumed to have equal a priori probabilities and equal\nmessage sizes. We derive the semantic PIR capacity for general $K$, $N$. The\nresults show that the semantic PIR capacity depends on the number of databases\n$N$, the number of messages $K$, the a priori probability distribution of\nmessages $p_i$, and the message sizes $L_i$. We present two achievable semantic\nPIR schemes: The first one is a deterministic scheme which is based on message\nasymmetry. This scheme employs non-uniform subpacketization. The second scheme\nis probabilistic and is based on choosing one query set out of multiple options\nat random to retrieve the required message without the need for exponential\nsubpacketization. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the\nsemantic PIR capacity to exceed the classical PIR capacity with equal priors\nand sizes.
