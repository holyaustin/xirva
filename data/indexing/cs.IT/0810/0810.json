An instance of the index coding\nproblem includes a sender that holds a set of information messages\n$X=\\{x_1,...,x_k\\}$ and a set of receivers $R$. Each receiver $\\rho=(x,H)\\in R$\nneeds to obtain a message $x\\in X$ and has prior \\emph{side information}\ncomprising a subset $H$ of $X$. The sender uses a noiseless communication\nchannel to broadcast encoding of messages in $X$ to all clients. The objective\nis to find an encoding scheme that minimizes the number of transmissions\nrequired to satisfy the receivers' demands with \\emph{zero error}.\n  In this paper, we analyze the relation between the index coding problem, the\nmore general network coding problem and the problem of finding a linear\nrepresentation of a matroid. In particular, we show that any instance of the\nnetwork coding and matroid representation problems can be efficiently reduced\nto an instance of the index coding problem. Our reduction implies that many\nimportant properties of the network coding and matroid representation problems\ncarry over to the index coding problem. Specifically, we show that \\emph{vector\nlinear codes} outperform scalar linear codes and that vector linear codes are\ninsufficient for achieving the optimum number of transmissions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Oct 2008 03:41:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Rouayheb", "Salim Y.

The design method consists in starting from the\nparity-check matrix of an LDPC code and developing an optimized parity-check\nmatrix, with the same performance on the memory-less erasure channel, and\nsuitable also for the iterative correction of single bursts of erasures. The\nparity-check matrix optimization is performed by an algorithm called pivot\nsearching and swapping (PSS) algorithm, which executes permutations of\ncarefully chosen columns of the parity-check matrix, after a local analysis of\nparticular variable nodes called stopping set pivots. This algorithm can be in\nprinciple applied to any LDPC code. If the input parity-check matrix is\ndesigned for achieving good performance on the memory-less erasure channel,\nthen the code obtained after the application of the PSS algorithm provides good\njoint correction of independent erasures and single erasure bursts. Numerical\nresults are provided in order to show the effectiveness of the PSS algorithm\nwhen applied to different categories of LDPC codes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Oct 2008 14:08:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-08", "authors_parsed": [["Paolini", "E.", ""], ["Chiani", "M.", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.1234", "submitter": "Ali Parandehgheibi", "authors": "Ali ParandehGheibi, Atilla Eryilmaz, Asuman Ozdaglar, Muriel Medard", "title": "On Resource Allocation in Fading Multiple Access Channels - An Efficient\n  Approximate Projection Approach", "comments": "32 pages, Submitted to IEEE Trans. on Information Theory", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TIT.2010.2053902", "report-no": "LIDS report 2787", "categories": "cs.IT cs.NI math.IT math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the problem of rate and power allocation in a multiple-access\nchannel.

We quantify analytically the trade off\nbetween precoder word length and transmission rate degradation. More\nspecifically, we prove a simple formula for the transmission rate loss as a\nfunction of the number of bits used for precoding, the signal to noise ratio,\nand the standard line parameters. We demonstrate, through simulations on real\nlines, the accuracy of our estimates. Moreover, our results are stable in the\npresence of channel estimation errors.

The optimum ordering of the relays and hence the\ncapacity of the half-duplex Gaussian parallel relay channel in the low and high\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios is derived. In the low SNR scenario, it\nis revealed that under certain conditions for the channel coefficients, the\nratio of the achievable rate of the simultaneous relaying based on DDF to the\ncut-set bound tends to be 1. On the other hand, as SNR goes to infinity, it is\nproved that successive relaying, based on the DPC, asymptotically achieves the\ncapacity of the network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 26 Oct 2008 04:31:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Rezaei", "Seyed Saeed Changiz", ""], ["Gharan", "Shahab Oveis", ""], ["Khandani", "Amir K.", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.4658", "submitter": "Keqin Liu", "authors": "Keqin Liu, Qing Zhao", "title": "Indexability of Restless Bandit Problems and Optimality of Whittle's\n  Index for Dynamic Multichannel Access", "comments": "submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a class of restless multi-armed bandit problems (RMBP) that\narises in dynamic multichannel access, user/server scheduling, and optimal\nactivation in multi-agent systems.
