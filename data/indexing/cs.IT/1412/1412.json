Although these questions sound\nphilosophical and pointless, they can be made precise in the framework of what\nwe call classical theories of quantum processes, which are a reword of quantum\nphenomena in the language of classical probability theory. In 2012, Pusey,\nBarrett and Rudolph (PBR) proved, under an assumption of preparation\nindependence, a theorem supporting the original interpretation of Schrodinger\nin the classical framework. Recently, we showed that these questions are\nrelated to a practical problem in quantum communication complexity, namely,\nquantifying the minimal amount of classical communication required in the\nclassical simulation of a two-party quantum communication process. In\nparticular, we argued that the statement of the PBR theorem can be proved if\nthe classical communication cost of simulating the communication of n qubits\ngrows more than exponentially in 'n'. Our argument is based on an assumption\nthat we call probability equipartition property. This property is somehow\nweaker than the preparation independence property used in the PBR theorem, as\nthe former can be justified by the latter and the asymptotic equipartition\nproperty of independent stochastic sources. The equipartition property is a\ngeneral and natural hypothesis that can be assumed even if the preparation\nindependence hypothesis is dropped.

The global convergence of Block-IBA is analyzed and proved, and\nthe effectiveness of Block-IBA is demonstrated by numerical experiments and\nsimulations on synthetic and real-life data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 7 Dec 2014 04:44:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-09", "authors_parsed": [["Korki", "Mehdi", ""], ["Zhang", "Jingxin", ""], ["Zhang", "Cishen", ""], ["Zayyani", "Hadi", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.2391", "submitter": "Mohsen Karimzadeh Kiskani", "authors": "Mohsen Karimzadeh Kiskani and Hamid R.

Nevertheless, in many practical\napplications such as direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation and line spectral\nestimation, the sparsifying dictionary is usually characterized by a set of\nunknown parameters in a continuous domain. To apply the conventional compressed\nsensing technique to such applications, the continuous parameter space has to\nbe discretized to a finite set of grid points, based on which a \"presumed\ndictionary\" is constructed for sparse signal recovery. Discretization, however,\ninevitably incurs errors since the true parameters do not necessarily lie on\nthe discretized grid.

In this\npaper, to prove the effectiveness of the proposed 5G cellular networks with\nmm-wave access, system level simulation is conducted by introducing an expected\nfuture traffic model, a measurement based mm-wave propagation model, and a\ncentralized cell association algorithm by exploiting the C-RAN architecture.\nThe numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed network to realize\n1000 times higher system rate than the current network in 10 years which is not\nachieved by the small cells using commonly considered 3.5 GHz band.\nFurthermore, the paper also gives latest status of mm-wave devices and\nregulations to show the feasibility of using mm-wave in the 5G systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Dec 2014 07:09:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 16 Dec 2014 12:45:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-19", "authors_parsed": [["Sakaguchi", "Kei", ""], ["Tran", "Gia Khanh", ""], ["Shimodaira", "Hidekazu", ""], ["Nanba", "Shinobu", ""], ["Sakurai", "Toshiaki", ""], ["Takinami", "Koji", ""], ["Siaud", "Isabelle", ""], ["Strinati", "Emilio Calvanese", ""], ["Capone", "Antonio", ""], ["Karls", "Ingolf", ""], ["Arefi", "Reza", ""], ["Haustein", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.3238", "submitter": "Hampei Sasahara", "authors": "Hampei Sasahara, Masaaki Nagahara, Kazunori Hayashi, Yutaka Yamamoto", "title": "Loop-Back Interference Suppression for OFDM Signals via Sampled-Data\n  Control", "comments": "10th Asian Control Conference 2015 (ASCC 2015), 2015; 4 pages, 10\n  figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SY cs.IT math.IT math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this article, we consider the problem of loop-back interference\nsuppression for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals in\namplify-and-forward single-frequency full-duplex relay stations.

Since the amplitude information of sparse\nsignals in 1-bit CS is not available, it is often the support or the sign of a\nsignal that can be exactly recovered with a decoding method. In this paper, we\nfirst show that a necessary assumption (that has been overlooked in the\nliterature) should be made for some existing theories and discussions for 1-bit\nCS. Without such an assumption, the found solution by some existing decoding\nalgorithms might be inconsistent with 1-bit measurements. This motivates us to\npursue a new direction to develop uniform and nonuniform recovery theories for\n1-bit CS with a new decoding method which always generates a solution\nconsistent with 1-bit measurements. We focus on an extreme case of 1-bit CS, in\nwhich the measurements capture only the sign of the product of a sensing matrix\nand a signal. We show that the 1-bit CS model can be reformulated equivalently\nas an $\\ell_0$-minimization problem with linear constraints. This reformulation\nnaturally leads to a new linear-program-based decoding method, referred to as\nthe 1-bit basis pursuit, which is remarkably different from existing\nformulations. It turns out that the uniqueness condition for the solution of\nthe 1-bit basis pursuit yields the so-called restricted range space property\n(RRSP) of the transposed sensing matrix.

Later on we extend the results to heterogeneous sensors\nand propose a robust scheduling design when we have traffic and channel\nuncertainty. We propose three sensing strategies, and, within each one of them,\nseveral solutions, striking a balance between throughput performance and\ncomputational complexity, are proposed. In addition, we show that a sequential\nchannel sensing strategy is the one to be preferred when the sensing time is\nsmall, the number of channels is large, and the number of users is small. For\nall the other cases, a parallel channel sensing strategy is recommended in\nterms of throughput performance. We also show that a proposed hybrid\nsequential-parallel channel sensing strategy achieves the best performance in\nall scenarios at the cost of extra memory and computation complexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Dec 2014 22:05:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 27 Jan 2015 19:12:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 19 May 2015 20:35:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-21", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Chun-Hao", ""], ["Azarfar", "Arash", ""], ["Frigon", "Jean-Francois", ""], ["Sanso", "Brunilde", ""], ["Cabric", "Danijela", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.6058", "submitter": "Mingyi Hong", "authors": "Mingyi Hong", "title": "A Distributed, Asynchronous and Incremental Algorithm for Nonconvex\n  Optimization: An ADMM Based Approach", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has been popular for\nsolving many signal processing problems, convex or nonconvex.

We propose the so-called multi-packet HARQ where the\ntransmitter allows different packets to share the same channel block. In this\nway the resources (block) are optimally assigned throughout the transmission\nrounds. This stands in contrast with the conventional HARQ, where each\ntransmission round occupies the entire block. We analyze superposition coding\nand time-sharing transmission strategies and we optimize the parameters to\nmaximize the throughput. Besides the conventional one-bit feedback (ACK/NACK)\nwe also consider the rich, multi-bit feedback. To solve the optimization\nproblem we formulate it as a Markov decision process (MDP) problem where the\ndecisions are taken using accumulated mutual information (AMI) obtained from\nthe receiver via delayed feedback. When only one-bit feedback is used to inform\nthe transmitter about the decoding success/failure (ACK/NACK), the Partial\nState Information Markov Decision Process (PSI-MDP) framework is used to obtain\nthe optimal policies.

However, FD operation increases the\naggregate interference on each communication link, which limits the capacity\nimprovement. In this paper, we investigate how much of the potential doubling\ncan be practically achieved in the resource-managed, small multi-cellular\nsystem, similar to the TDD variant of LTE, both in indoor and outdoor\nenvironments, assuming FD base stations (BSs) and HD user equipment (UEs). We\nfocus on low-powered small cellular systems, because they are more suitable for\nFD operation given practical self-interference cancellation limits. A joint UE\nselection and power allocation method for a multi-cell scenario is presented,\nwhere a hybrid scheduling policy assigns FD timeslots when it provides a\nthroughput advantage by pairing UEs with appropriate power levels to mitigate\nthe mutual interference, but otherwise defaults to HD operation. Due to the\ncomplexity of finding the globally optimum solution of the proposed algorithm,\na sub-optimal method based on a heuristic greedy algorithm for UE selection,\nand a novel solution using geometric programming for power allocation, is\nproposed. With practical self-interference cancellation, antennas and circuits,\nit is shown that the proposed hybrid FD system achieves as much as 94%\nthroughput improvement in the downlink, and 92% in the uplink, compared to a HD\nsystem in an indoor multi-cell scenario and 54% in downlink and 61% in uplink\nin an outdoor multi-cell scenario. Further, we also compare the energy\nefficiency of FD operation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Dec 2014 17:55:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 6 Jan 2015 00:56:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 9 Mar 2015 21:31:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 2 Apr 2015 17:23:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 30 Sep 2015 04:31:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Goyal", "Sanjay", ""], ["Liu", "Pei", ""], ["Panwar", "Shivendra", ""], ["Yang", "Rui", ""], ["DiFazio", "Robert A.", ""], ["Bala", "Erdem", ""]]}]
