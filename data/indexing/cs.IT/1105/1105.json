One of the main challenges in dynamic spectrum\naccess is to determine when the \\emph{secondary} (unlicensed) users can use the\nspectrum. In particular, when the secondary user is using the spectrum, if the\nprimary user becomes active to use the spectrum, it is usually hard for the\nsecondary user to detect the primary user instantaneously, thus causing\nunexpected interference and delay to primary users. The secondary user cannot\ndetect the presence of primary users instantaneously because the secondary user\nis unable to detect the spectrum at the same time while it is transmitting. To\nsolve this problem, we propose the full duplex wireless communications scheme\nfor CRNs. In particular, we employ the Antennas Cancellation (AC), the RF\nInterference Cancellation (RIC), and the Digital Interference Cancellation\n(DIC) techniques for secondary users so that the secondary user can scan for\nactive primary users while it is transmitting. Once detecting the presence of\nprimary users, the secondary user will release the spectrum instantaneously to\navoid the interference and delay to primary users. We analyze the packet loss\nrate of primary users in wireless full duplex CRNs, and compare them with the\npacket loss rate of primary users in wireless half duplex CRNs.

We study how the structure of the function\naffects the encoding strategies, and the effect of interactive information\nexchange.\n  We begin by considering a directed graph G = (V, E) on the sensor nodes,\nwhere the goal is to determine the optimal encoders on each edge which achieve\nfunction computation at the collector node. Our goal is to characterize the\nrate region in R^{|E|}, i.e., the set of points for which there exist feasible\nencoders with given rates which achieve zero-error computation for\nasymptotically large block length. We determine the solution for directed\ntrees, specifying the optimal encoder and decoder for each edge. For general\ndirected acyclic graphs, we provide an outer bound on the rate region by\nfinding the disambiguation requirements for each cut, and describe examples\nwhere this outer bound is tight.\n  Next, we address the scenario where nodes are connected in an undirected tree\nnetwork, and every node wishes to compute a given symmetric Boolean function of\nthe sensor data. Undirected edges permit interactive computation, and we\ntherefore study the effect of interaction on the aggregation and communication\nstrategies. We focus on sum-threshold functions, and determine the minimum\nworst-case total number of bits to be exchanged on each edge. The optimal\nstrategy involves recursive in-network aggregation which is reminiscent of\nmessage passing. In the case of general graphs, we present a cutset lower\nbound, and an achievable scheme based on aggregation along trees. For complete\ngraphs, we prove that the complexity of this scheme is no more than twice that\nof the optimal scheme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 May 2011 04:39:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Aug 2011 05:02:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Kowshik", "Hemant", ""], ["Kumar", "P.

However, few algorithms\nexplicitly consider correlation within a cluster. Meanwhile, in the multiple\nmeasurement vector (MMV) model correlation among multiple solution vectors is\nlargely ignored. Although several recently developed algorithms consider the\nexploitation of the correlation, these algorithms need to know a priori the\ncorrelation structure, thus limiting their effectiveness in practical problems.\n  Recently, we developed a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm, namely\nT-SBL, and its variants, which adaptively learn the correlation structure and\nexploit such correlation information to significantly improve reconstruction\nperformance. Here we establish their connections to other popular algorithms,\nsuch as the group Lasso, iterative reweighted $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ algorithms,\nand algorithms for time-varying sparsity. We also provide strategies to improve\nthese existing algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 May 2011 02:43:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 9 Jun 2011 23:43:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-13", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Zhilin", ""], ["Rao", "Bhaskar D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.0769", "submitter": "Georg Tauboeck", "authors": "Georg Tauboeck", "title": "Complex-Valued Random Vectors and Channels: Entropy, Divergence, and\n  Capacity", "comments": "33 pages, 1 figure, slightly modified version of first paper revision\n  submitted to IEEE Trans.

The key observation is that the resolution\ninformation of the first receiver is correlated with that of the second. This\ncorrelated information is efficiently transmitted via joint source-channel\ncoding, using ideas similar to the Han-Costa coding scheme. Using the result,\nwe obtain an achievable rate region for the stochastically degraded AWGN\nbroadcast channel with noisy feedback from only one receiver. It is shown that\nthis region is strictly larger than the no-feedback capacity region.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 May 2011 20:36:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 7 Jan 2012 01:33:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 12 Oct 2012 15:22:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 19 Jul 2013 15:19:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-10", "authors_parsed": [["Venkataramanan", "Ramji", ""], ["Pradhan", "S.

Kol (IEEE INFOCOM, 1998). In the present work, a generalization of\nindex coding scheme, where transmitted symbols are subject to errors, is\nstudied. Error-correcting methods for such a scheme, and their parameters, are\ninvestigated. In particular, the following question is discussed: given the\nside information hypergraph of index coding scheme and the maximal number of\nerroneous symbols $\\delta$, what is the shortest length of a linear index code,\nsuch that every receiver is able to recover the required information? This\nquestion turns out to be a generalization of the problem of finding a\nshortest-length error-correcting code with a prescribed error-correcting\ncapability in the classical coding theory.\n  The Singleton bound and two other bounds, referred to as the $\\alpha$-bound\nand the $\\kappa$-bound, for the optimal length of a linear error-correcting\nindex code (ECIC) are established. For large alphabets, a construction based on\nconcatenation of an optimal index code with an MDS classical code, is shown to\nattain the Singleton bound. For smaller alphabets, however, this construction\nmay not be optimal. A random construction is also analyzed. It yields another\nimplicit bound on the length of an optimal linear ECIC.\n  Further, the problem of error-correcting decoding by a linear ECIC is\nstudied. It is shown that in order to decode correctly the desired symbol, the\ndecoder is required to find one of the vectors, belonging to an affine space\ncontaining the actual error vector. The syndrome decoding is shown to produce\nthe correct output if the weight of the error pattern is less or equal to the\nerror-correcting capability of the corresponding ECIC.\n  Finally, the notion of static ECIC, which is suitable for use with a family\nof instances of an index coding problem, is introduced.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 14 May 2011 05:49:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-17", "authors_parsed": [["Dau", "Son Hoang", ""], ["Skachek", "Vitaly", ""], ["Chee", "Yeow Meng", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.2952", "submitter": "Bela Frigyik", "authors": "Bela A.

That is,\nsymbols transmitted by different transmitters could arrive at the receiver with\nsymbol misalignment as well as relative carrier-phase offset. A second\nimportant issue is how to integrate channel coding with PNC to achieve reliable\ncommunication. This paper investigates these two issues and makes the following\ncontributions: 1) We propose and investigate a general framework for decoding\nat the receiver based on belief propagation (BP). The framework can effectively\ndeal with symbol and phase asynchronies while incorporating channel coding at\nthe same time. 2) For unchannel-coded PNC, we show that for BPSK and QPSK\nmodulations, our BP method can significantly reduce the asynchrony penalties\ncompared with prior methods. 3) For unchannel-coded PNC, with half symbol\noffset between the transmitters, our BP method can drastically reduce the\nperformance penalty due to phase asynchrony, from more than 6 dB to no more\nthan 1 dB. 4) For channel-coded PNC, with our BP method, both symbol and phase\nasynchronies actually improve the system performance compared with the\nperfectly synchronous case. Furthermore, the performance spread due to\ndifferent combinations of symbol and phase offsets between the transmitters in\nchannel-coded PNC is only around 1 dB. The implication of 3) is that if we\ncould control the symbol arrival times at the receiver, it would be\nadvantageous to deliberately introduce a half symbol offset in unchannel-coded\nPNC. The implication of 4) is that when channel coding is used, symbol and\nphase asynchronies are not major performance concerns in PNC.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 May 2011 16:48:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 19 May 2011 07:59:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 21 May 2011 12:13:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 5 Jun 2011 13:34:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Lu", "Lu", ""], ["Liew", "Soung Chang", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.3259", "submitter": "Frank Nielsen", "authors": "Frank Nielsen and Richard Nock", "title": "On R\\'enyi and Tsallis entropies and divergences for exponential\n  families", "comments": "7 pages", "journal-ref": "Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical, Volume 45\n  Number 3, 2012", "doi": "10.1088/1751-8113/45/3/032003", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.LG math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Many common probability distributions in statistics like the Gaussian,\nmultinomial, Beta or Gamma distributions can be studied under the unified\nframework of exponential families.

To date, only a simplified\nversion of physical-layer network coding (PNC) method, called analog network\ncoding (ANC), has been successfully implemented. The advantage of ANC is that\nit is simple to implement; the disadvantage, on the other hand, is that the\nrelay amplifies the noise along with the signal before forwarding the signal.\nPNC systems in which the relay performs XOR or other denoising PNC mappings of\nthe received signal have the potential for significantly better performance.\nHowever, the implementation of such PNC systems poses many challenges. For\nexample, the relay must be able to deal with symbol and carrier-phase\nasynchronies of the simultaneous signals received from the two end nodes, and\nthe relay must perform channel estimation before detecting the signals. We\ninvestigate a PNC implementation in the frequency domain, referred to as FPNC,\nto tackle these challenges. FPNC is based on OFDM. In FPNC, XOR mapping is\nperformed on the OFDM samples in each subcarrier rather than on the samples in\nthe time domain. We implement FPNC on the universal soft radio peripheral\n(USRP) platform. Our implementation requires only moderate modifications of the\npacket preamble design of 802.11a/g OFDM PHY.

Under this constraint, we investigate two\npractical designs for the co-located receiver case, namely time switching and\npower splitting, and characterize their achievable R-E regions in comparison to\nthe outer bound.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 May 2011 12:13:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 10 Feb 2012 11:10:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 15 Feb 2013 06:42:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Rui", ""], ["Ho", "Chin Keong", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.5072", "submitter": "Anas Chaaban", "authors": "Anas Chaaban and Aydin Sezgin", "title": "Sub-optimality of Treating Interference as Noise in the Cellular Uplink", "comments": "5 pages, 3 figures, typos corrected", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Despite the simplicity of the scheme of treating interference as noise (TIN),\nit was shown to be sum-capacity optimal in the Gaussian 2-user interference\nchannel in \\cite{ShangKramerChen,MotahariKhandani,AnnapureddyVeeravalli}.

Most prior work on IA is based on the impractical assumption that\nperfect and global channel-state information(CSI) is available at all\ntransmitters. To implement IA, each receiver has to feed back CSI to all\ninterferers, resulting in overwhelming feedback overhead. In particular, the\nsum feedback rate of each receiver scales quadratically with the number of\nusers even if the quantized CSI is fed back. To substantially suppress feedback\noverhead, this paper focuses on designing efficient arrangements of feedback\nlinks, called feedback topologies, under the IA constraint. For the\nmultiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) K-user interference channel, we propose\nthe feedback topology that supports sequential CSI exchange (feedback and\nfeedforward) between transmitters and receivers so as to achieve IA\nprogressively. This feedback topology is shown to reduce the network feedback\noverhead from a cubic function of K to a linear one. To reduce the delay in the\nsequential CSI exchange, an alternative feedback topology is designed for\nsupporting two-hop feedback via a control station, which also achieves the\nlinear feedback scaling with K. Next, given the proposed feedback topologies,\nthe feedback-bit allocation algorithm is designed for allocating feedback bits\nby each receiver to different feedback links so as to regulate the residual\ninterference caused by the finite-rate feedback. Simulation results demonstrate\nthat the proposed bit allocation leads to significant throughput gains\nespecially in strong interference environments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 May 2011 04:40:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 24 May 2012 03:47:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 25 May 2012 00:39:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 29 May 2012 05:36:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Cho", "Sungyoon", ""], ["Huang", "Kaibin", ""], ["Kim", "Dongku", ""], ["Lau", "Vincent K.

Jaynes, originator of the maximum entropy interpretation of statistical\nmechanics, emphasized that there is an inevitable trade-off between the\nconflicting requirements of robustness and accuracy for any inferencing\nalgorithm. This is because robustness requires discarding of information in\norder to reduce the sensitivity to outliers. The principal of nonlinear\nstatistical coupling, which is an interpretation of the Tsallis entropy\ngeneralization, can be used to quantify this trade-off. The coupled-surprisal,\n-ln_k (p)=-(p^k-1)/k, is a generalization of Shannon surprisal or the\nlogarithmic scoring rule, given a forecast p of a true event by an inferencing\nalgorithm. The coupling parameter k=1-q, where q is the Tsallis entropy index,\nis the degree of nonlinear coupling between statistical states. Positive\n(negative) values of nonlinear coupling decrease (increase) the surprisal\ninformation metric and thereby biases the risk in favor of decisive (robust)\nalgorithms relative to the Shannon surprisal (k=0).

In this context, random linear network\ncodes (dense codes) are asymptotically capacity-achieving, but require highly\ncomplex coding operations. To reduce the coding complexity, Maymounkov et al.\nproposed chunked codes (CC). Chunked codes operate by splitting the message\ninto non-overlapping chunks and send a randomly chosen chunk at each\ntransmission time by a dense code. The complexity, that is linear in the chunk\nsize, is thus reduced compared to dense codes. In this paper, the existing\nanalysis of CC is revised, and tighter bounds on the performance of CC are\nderived. As a result, we prove that (i) CC with sufficiently large chunks are\nasymptotically capacity-achieving, but with a slower speed of convergence\ncompared to dense codes; and (ii) CC with relatively smaller chunks approach\nthe capacity with an arbitrarily small but non-zero constant gap. To improve\nthe speed of convergence of CC, while maintaining their advantage in reducing\nthe computational complexity, we propose and analyze a new CC scheme with\noverlapping chunks, referred to as overlapped chunked codes (OCC). We prove\nthat for smaller chunks, which are advantageous due to lower computational\ncomplexity, OCC with larger overlaps provide a better tradeoff between the\nspeed of convergence and the message or packet error rate. This implies that\nfor smaller chunks, and with the same computational complexity, OCC outperform\nCC in terms of the speed of approaching the capacity for sufficiently small\ntarget error rate. In fact, we design linear-time OCC with very small chunks\n(constant in the message size) that are both computationally and\ncommunicationally efficient, and that outperform linear-time CC.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 May 2011 19:55:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Heidarzadeh", "Anoosheh", ""], ["Banihashemi", "Amir H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.5755", "submitter": "Himanshu Asnani", "authors": "Himanshu Asnani and Tsachy Weissman", "title": "On Real Time Coding with Limited Lookahead", "comments": "27 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information\n  Theory", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A real time coding system with lookahead consists of a memoryless source, a\nmemoryless channel, an encoder, which encodes the source symbols sequentially\nwith knowledge of future source symbols upto a fixed finite lookahead, d, with\nor without feedback of the past channel output symbols and a decoder, which\nsequentially constructs the source symbols using the channel output.

We additionally use state evolution to design MSE-optimal\nscalar quantizers for GAMP signal reconstruction and empirically demonstrate\nthe superior error performance of the resulting quantizers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 May 2011 19:31:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 20 Nov 2011 05:01:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Kamilov", "Ulugbek", ""], ["Goyal", "Vivek K.", ""], ["Rangan", "Sundeep", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.6374", "submitter": "Arvind Yedla", "authors": "Arvind Yedla, Henry D.

Each channel capacity is assumed to be characterized by a\nsingle parameter which is not known at the transmitter. The receiver has\nknowledge of both the source correlation and the channel parameters. We call a\nsystem universal if it retains near-capacity performance without channel\nknowledge at the transmitter. Kudekar et al. recently showed that terminated\nlow-density parity-check (LDPC) convolutional codes (a.k.a. spatially-coupled\nLDPC ensembles) can have belief-propagation thresholds that approach their\nmaximum a-posteriori thresholds. This was proven for binary erasure channels\nand shown empirically for binary memoryless symmetric channels. They also\nconjectured that the principle of spatial coupling is very general and the\nphenomenon of threshold saturation applies to a very broad class of graphical\nmodels. In this work, we derive an area theorem for the joint decoder and\nempirically show that threshold saturation occurs for this problem. As a\nresult, we demonstrate near-universal performance for this problem using the\nproposed spatially-coupled coding system. A similar result is also discussed\nbriefly for the 2-user multiple-access channel.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 May 2011 19:48:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Yedla", "Arvind", ""], ["Pfister", "Henry D.", ""], ["Narayanan", "Krishna", ""]]}]
