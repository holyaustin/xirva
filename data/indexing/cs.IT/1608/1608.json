This work shows that the level of security depends on the set of\nhashed values of valid users as well as the statistical profile of a hash\nfunction, resulting from bias. We examine the average guesswork conditioned on\nthe set of hashed values, and model the statistical profile through the\nempirical distribution of the number of inputs that are mapped to a bin. In\nparticular, we focus on a class of statistical profiles (capturing the bias) ,\nwhich we call type-class statistical profiles, that has an empirical\ndistribution related to the probability of the type classes defined in the\nmethod of types. For such profiles, we show that the average guesswork is\nrelated to basic measures in information theory such as entropy and divergence.\nWe use this to show that the effect of bias on the conditional average\nguesswork is limited compared to other system parameters such as the number of\nvalid users who store their hashed passwords in the system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 6 Aug 2016 17:45:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 31 Dec 2016 01:13:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 9 Jan 2017 22:13:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 11 Jan 2017 07:29:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sun, 3 Mar 2019 21:26:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Wed, 27 Nov 2019 06:56:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-28", "authors_parsed": [["Yona", "Yair", ""], ["Diggavi", "Suhas", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.02169", "submitter": "Cunsheng Ding", "authors": "Shuxing Li, Cunsheng Ding, and Hao Liu", "title": "A Family of Reversible BCH Codes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Cyclic codes are an interesting class of linear codes due to their efficient\nencoding and decoding algorithms as well as their theoretical importance.

This approach is currently being standardized by 3GPP under the\nname of LTE Licensed-Assisted Access (LTE-LAA). In this paper, we take a\nholistic approach for LTE-LAA small cell traffic balancing by jointly\noptimizing the use of the licensed and unlicensed bands. We pose this traffic\nbalancing as an optimization problem that seeks proportional fair coexistence\nof WiFi, small cell and macro cell users by adapting the transmission\nprobability of the LTE-LAA small cell in the licensed and unlicensed bands. The\nmotivation for this formulation is for the LTE-LAA small cell to switch between\nor aggregate licensed and unlicensed bands depending on the\ninterference/traffic level and the number of active users in each band. We\nderive a closed form solution for this optimization problem and additionally\npropose a transmission mechanism for the operation of the LTE-LAA small cell on\nboth bands.

However, BD is not\neasily translated to frequency-selective channels, since space-time information\nis required for transceiver design. In this paper, we demonstrate that BD is\nfeasible in frequency-selective MIMO broadcast channels to eliminate inter-user\ninterference (IUI) if the transmit block length is sufficiently large, and if\nthe number of transmit antennas is greater than the number of users. We also\npropose three different approaches to mitigate/eliminate inter-symbol\ninterference (ISI) in block transmissions: i) time-reversal-based BD (TRBD)\nwhich maximizes spatial focusing around the receivers using transmitter\nprocessing only, ii) equalized BD (EBD) which minimizes the ISI using\ntransmitter processing only, and iii) joint processing BD (JPBD), which uses\nlinear processing at the transmitter and the receiver to suppress ISI. We\nanalyze the theoretical diversity and multiplexing gains of these techniques,\nand we demonstrate that JPBD approximates full multiplexing gain for a\nsufficiently large transmit block length. Extensive numerical simulations show\nthat the achievable rate and probability of error performance of all the\nproposed methods improve those of conventional time-reversal beamforming.\nMoreover, JPBD provides the highest achievable rate region for\nfrequency-selective MIMO broadcast channels.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 21 Aug 2016 21:51:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-23", "authors_parsed": [["Viteri-Mera", "Carlos A.", ""], ["Teixeira", "Fernando L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.06026", "submitter": "Nan Qi", "authors": "Nan Qi, Ming Xiao, Theodoros A.

However, MIMO radar poses new challenges for both hardware design\nand digital processing. In particular, achieving high azimuth resolution\nrequires a large number of transmit and receive antennas. In addition, the\ndigital processing is performed on samples of the received signal, from each\ntransmitter to each receiver, at its Nyquist rate, which can be prohibitively\nlarge when high resolution is needed. Overcoming the rate bottleneck,\nsub-Nyquist sampling methods have been proposed that break the link between\nradar signal bandwidth and sampling rate.

To achieve higher\nsystem efficiency, massive antenna deployment with tight coordination is one\npotential strategy for designing 5G systems, but has two types of associated\nsystem overhead. First is the synchronization overhead, which can be reduced by\nimplementing a cloud radio access network (CRAN)-based architecture design,\nthat separates the baseband processing and radio access functionality to\nachieve better system synchronization. Second is the overhead for acquiring\nchannel state information (CSI) of the users present in the system, which,\nhowever, increases tremendously when instantaneous CSI is used to serve\nhigh-mobility users. To serve a large number of users, a CRAN system with a\ndense deployment of remote radio heads (RRHs) is considered, such that each\nuser has a line-of-sight (LOS) link with the corresponding RRH. Since, the\ntrajectory of movement for high-mobility users is predictable; therefore,\nfairly accurate position estimates for those users can be obtained, and can be\nused for resource allocation to serve the considered users.

A key question in this context relates to channel\nstate estimation, which allows the transmitter to adapt the code rate to the\nchannel. In this work, we characterize the trade-off between the estimation\nsequence length and data codeword length: shorter channel estimation leaves\nmore time for the actual payload transmission but reduces the estimation\naccuracy and causes more decoding errors. Using lower coding rates can mitigate\nthis effect, but may result in a higher backlog of data at the transmitter. We\nanalyze this trade-off using queueing analysis on top of accurate models of the\nphysical layer, which also account for the finite blocklength of the channel\ncode. Based on a novel closed-form approximation for the error probability\ngiven the rate, we show that finding the optimal rate adaptation strategy\nbecomes a convex problem. The optimal rate adaptation strategy and the optimal\ntraining sequence length, which both depend on the latency and reliability\nconstraints of the application, can improve the delay performance by an order\nof magnitude, compared to suboptimal strategies that do not consider those\nconstraints.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Aug 2016 13:38:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 2 Jun 2017 21:37:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Schiessl", "Sebastian", ""], ["Al-Zubaidy", "Hussein", ""], ["Skoglund", "Mikael", ""], ["Gross", "James", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.08450", "submitter": "Mohit Virmani", "authors": "Mohit Virmani, Nithin Nagaraj", "title": "A Compression-Complexity Measure of Integrated Information", "comments": "28 pages, 10 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Quantifying integrated information is a leading approach towards building a\nfundamental theory of consciousness.
