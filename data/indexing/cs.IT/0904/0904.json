We\nthen discovered that, in the interpretation, the temperature T equals to the\npartial randomness of the values of all these thermodynamic quantities, where\nthe notion of partial randomness is a stronger representation of the\ncompression rate by means of program-size complexity. Furthermore, we showed\nthat this situation holds for the temperature itself as a thermodynamic\nquantity, namely, for each of all the thermodynamic quantities above, the\ncomputability of its value at temperature T gives a sufficient condition for T\nin (0,1) to be a fixed point on partial randomness. In this paper, we develop\nthe statistical mechanical interpretation of AIT further and pursue its formal\ncorrespondence to normal statistical mechanics. The thermodynamic quantities in\nAIT are defined based on the halting set of an optimal computer, which is a\nuniversal decoding algorithm used to define the notion of program-size\ncomplexity. We show that there are infinitely many optimal computers which give\ncompletely different sufficient conditions in each of the thermodynamic\nquantities in AIT. We do this by introducing the notion of composition of\ncomputers into AIT, which corresponds to the notion of composition of systems\nin normal statistical mechanics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Apr 2009 17:11:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 9 Aug 2009 20:59:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Tadaki", "Kohtaro", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.0994", "submitter": "M.

A tag may be\nmissing (left unread) due to errors in the communication link towards the\nreader e.g. due to obstacles in the radio path. The present paper proposes\ntechniques that use multiple reader sessions, during which the system of\nreaders obtains a running estimate of the probability to have at least one tag\nmissing. Based on such an estimate, it is decided whether an additional reader\nsession is required. Two methods are proposed, they rely on the statistical\nindependence of the tag reading errors across different reader sessions, which\nis a plausible assumption when e.g. each reader session is executed on\ndifferent readers. The first method uses statistical relationships that are\nvalid when the reader sessions are independent. The second method is obtained\nby modifying an existing capture-recapture estimator. The results show that,\nwhen the reader sessions are independent, the proposed mechanisms provide a\ngood approximation to the probability of missing tags, such that the number of\nreader sessions made, meets the target specification. If the assumption of\nindependence is violated, the estimators are still useful, but they should be\ncorrected by a margin of additional reader sessions to ensure that the target\nprobability of missing tags is met.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 16 Apr 2009 07:33:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Jacobsen", "Rasmus", ""], ["Nielsen", "Karsten Fyhn", ""], ["Popovski", "Petar", ""], ["Larsen", "Torben", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.2477", "submitter": "Peter Harremo\\\"es", "authors": "Peter Harremo\\\"es", "title": "Joint Range of R\\'enyi Entropies", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The exact range of the joined values of several R\\'{e}nyi entropies is\ndetermined.

However, this assumption can be violated\nin practice. In this paper, we analyze inter-session network coding in a wired\nnetwork using game theory. We assume selfish users acting strategically to\nmaximize their own utility, leading to a resource allocation game among users.\nIn particular, we study the well-known butterfly network topology where a\nbottleneck link is shared by several network coding and routing flows. We prove\nthe existence of a Nash equilibrium for a wide range of utility functions. We\nshow that the number of Nash equilibria can be large (even infinite) for\ncertain choices of system parameters. This is in sharp contrast to a similar\ngame setting with traditional packet forwarding where the Nash equilibrium is\nalways unique. We then characterize the worst-case efficiency bounds, i.e., the\nPrice-of-Anarchy (PoA), compared to an optimal and cooperative network design.\nWe show that by using a novel discriminatory pricing scheme which charges\nencoded and forwarded packets differently, we can improve the PoA. However,\nregardless of the discriminatory pricing scheme being used, the PoA is still\nworse than for the case when network coding is not applied. This implies that,\nalthough inter-session network coding can improve performance compared to\nordinary routing, it is significantly more sensitive to users' strategic\nbehaviour. For example, in a butterfly network where the side links have zero\ncost, the efficiency can be as low as 25%. If the side links have non-zero\ncost, then the efficiency can further reduce to only 20%.

The perhaps surprising result is that the typically sufficient\nnumber of training samples $\\nsig$ grows up to a logarithmic factor only\nlinearly with the signal dimension, i.e. $\\nsig \\approx C \\natoms \\log\n\\natoms$, in contrast to previous approaches requiring combinatorially many\nsamples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Apr 2009 10:04:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 1 Mar 2010 11:28:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Gribonval", "Remi", ""], ["Schnass", "Karin", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.4789", "submitter": "Tarik Ait-Idir", "authors": "Houda Chafnaji, Tarik Ait-Idir, Samir Saoudi, and Athanasios V.\n  Vasilakos", "title": "Frequency Domain Hybrid-ARQ Chase Combining for Broadband MIMO CDMA\n  Systems", "comments": "Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology (Apr 2009)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1186/1687-1499-2012-134", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we consider high-speed wireless packet access using code\ndivision multiple access (CDMA) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO).\nCurrent wireless standards, such as high speed packet access (HSPA), have\nadopted multi-code transmission and hybrid-automatic repeat request (ARQ) as\nmajor technologies for delivering high data rates. The key technique in\nhybrid-ARQ, is that erroneous data packets are kept in the receiver to\ndetect/decode retransmitted ones. This strategy is refereed to as packet\ncombining. In CDMA MIMO-based wireless packet access, multi-code transmission\nsuffers from severe performance degradation due to the loss of code\northogonality caused by both interchip interference (ICI) and co-antenna\ninterference (CAI). This limitation results in large transmission delays when\nan ARQ mechanism is used in the link layer. In this paper, we investigate\nefficient minimum mean square error (MMSE) frequency domain equalization\n(FDE)-based iterative (turbo) packet combining for cyclic prefix (CP)-CDMA MIMO\nwith Chase-type ARQ. We introduce two turbo packet combining schemes: i) In the\nfirst scheme, namely \"chip-level turbo packet combining\", MMSE FDE and packet\ncombining are jointly performed at the chip-level. ii) In the second scheme,\nnamely \"symbol-level turbo packet combining\", chip-level MMSE FDE and\ndespreading are separately carried out for each transmission, then packet\ncombining is performed at the level of the soft demapper. The computational\ncomplexity and memory requirements of both techniques are quite insensitive to\nthe ARQ delay, i.e., maximum number of ARQ rounds. The throughput is evaluated\nfor some representative antenna configurations and load factors to show the\ngains offered by the proposed techniques.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Apr 2009 13:22:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Chafnaji", "Houda", ""], ["Ait-Idir", "Tarik", ""], ["Saoudi", "Samir", ""], ["Vasilakos", "Athanasios V.", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.4900", "submitter": "Miquel Payar\\'o", "authors": "Miquel Payar\\'o and Daniel P.

Towards providing a solution to this problem, we\nintroduce a variable-rate (VR) M-PSK modulation scheme, for communications over\nfading channels, in the absence of channel gain estimation at the receiver. The\nchoice of the constellation size is based on the signal-plus-noise (S+N)\nsampling value rather than on the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). It is\nanalytically shown that S+N can serve as an excellent simpler criterion,\nalternative to S/N, for determining the modulation order in VR systems.
