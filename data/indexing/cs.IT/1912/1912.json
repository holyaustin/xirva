To exploit the location-dependent and spatially varying\nchannel as well as interference over the 3D space, we propose a new radio map\nbased path planning framework for the UAV.

By leveraging the obtained SINR map, we proceed to derive\nthe optimal UAV path by solving an equivalent shortest path problem (SPP) in\ngraph theory.

Prior works\non IRS mainly rely on the instantaneous channel state information (I-CSI),\nwhich, however, is practically difficult to obtain for IRS-associated links due\nto its passive operation and large number of elements.

Synaptic signaling is a natural implementation of this\nparadigm.

Many of its features are not yet understood, some are,\nhowever, known to be critical for robust, reliable neural communication. In\nparticular, some synapses feature a re-uptake mechanism at the presynaptic\nneuron, which provides a means for removing neurotransmitters from the synaptic\ncleft and for recycling them for future reuse.

Although a plethora of modern physical layer solutions have\nbeen introduced in the last few decades, it is undeniable that a level of\nsaturation has been reached in terms of the available spectrum, adapted\nmodulation/coding solutions and accordingly the maximum capacity. Within this\ncontext, communications through reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs),\nwhich enable novel and effective functionalities including wave absorption,\ntuneable anomalous reflection, and reflection phase modification, appear as a\npotential candidate to overcome the inherent drawbacks of legacy wireless\nsystems. The core idea of RISs is the transformation of the uncontrollable and\nrandom wireless propagation environment into a reconfigurable communication\nsystem entity that plays an active role in forwarding information. In this\npaper, the well-known multipath fading phenomenon is revisited in mobile\nwireless communication systems, and novel and unique solutions are introduced\nfrom the perspective of RISs. The feasibility of eliminating or mitigating the\nmultipath fading effect stemming from the movement of mobile receivers is also\ninvestigated by utilizing the RISs. It is shown that rapid fluctuations in the\nreceived signal strength due to the Doppler effect can be effectively reduced\nby using the real-time tuneable RISs. It is also proven that the multipath\nfading effect can be totally eliminated when all reflectors in a propagation\nenvironment are coated with RISs, while even a few RISs can significantly\nreduce the Doppler spread as well as the deep fades in the received signal for\ngeneral propagation environments with several interacting objects.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Dec 2019 14:32:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 5 Nov 2020 21:32:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Basar", "Ertugrul", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.04096", "submitter": "Felipe G\\'omez-Cuba", "authors": "Felipe Gomez-Cuba, Michele Zorzi", "title": "Optimal Link Scheduling in Millimeter Wave Multi-hop Networks with\n  MU-MIMO radios", "comments": "Published in IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper studies the maximum throughput achievable with optimal scheduling\nin multi-hop mmWave picocellular networks with Multi-user Multiple-Input\nMultiple-Output (MU-MIMO) radios.

It this paper, we consider the problem\nof multiband channel sampling and TD estimation of MPCs. We assume that the\nnonideal multibranch receiver is used for multiband sampling, where the noise\nis nonuniform across the receiver branches. The resulting data model of Hankel\nmatrices formed from acquired samples has multiple shift-invariance structures,\nand we propose an algorithm for TD estimation using weighted subspace fitting.\nThe subspace fitting is formulated as a separable nonlinear least squares (NLS)\nproblem, and it is solved using a variable projection method. The proposed\nalgorithm supports high resolution TD estimation from an arbitrary number of\nbands, and it allows for nonuniform noise across the bands.

Coded computing is a technique that enables\nstraggler-resistant computation. Most coded computing techniques presented to\ndate provide robustness by ensuring that the time to finish depends only on a\nset of the fastest nodes. However, while stragglers do compute less work than\nnon-stragglers, in real-world commercial cloud computing systems (e.g.,\nAmazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)) the distinction is often a soft one. In\nthis paper, we develop hierarchical coded computing that exploits the work\ncompleted by all nodes, both fast and slow, automatically integrating the\npotential contribution of each. We first present a conceptual framework to\nrepresent the division of work amongst nodes in coded matrix multiplication as\na cuboid partitioning problem. This framework allows us to unify existing\nmethods and motivates new techniques. We then develop three methods of\nhierarchical coded computing that we term bit-interleaved coded computation\n(BICC), multilevel coded computation (MLCC), and hybrid hierarchical coded\ncomputation (HHCC). In this paradigm, each worker is tasked with completing a\nsequence (a hierarchy) of ordered subtasks. The sequence of subtasks, and the\ncomplexity of each, is designed so that partial work completed by stragglers\ncan be used, rather than ignored. We note that our methods can be used in\nconjunction with any coded computing method. We illustrate this by showing how\nwe can use our methods to accelerate all previously developed coded computing\ntechniques by enabling them to exploit stragglers.

To this end, we provide a\nspatiotemporal framework that captures the peak AoI (PAoI) for large scale IoT\nuplink network under time-triggered (TT) and event triggered (ET) traffic.\nTools from stochastic geometry and queueing theory are utilized to account for\nthe macroscopic and microscopic network scales. Simulations are conducted to\nvalidate the proposed mathematical framework and assess the effect of traffic\nload on PAoI. The results unveil a counter-intuitive superiority of the ET\ntraffic over the TT in terms of PAoI, which is due to the involved temporal\ninterference correlations. Insights regarding the network stability frontiers\nand the location-dependent performance are presented. Key design\nrecommendations regarding the traffic load and decoding thresholds are\nhighlighted.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Dec 2019 07:35:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Emara", "Mustafa", ""], ["ElSawy", "Hesham", ""], ["Bauch", "Gerhard", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.07960", "submitter": "Linsong Du", "authors": "Linsong Du and Shihai Shao Gang Yang and Jianhui Ma and Qinpeng Liang\n  and Youxi Tang", "title": "Capacity Characterization for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces\n  Assisted Multiple-Antenna Multicast", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "eess.SP cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), which consists of a large\nnumber of passive and low-cost reflecting elements, has been recognized as a\nrevolutionary technology to enhance the performance of future wireless\nnetworks.

Prior works on addressing these\nchallenges have focused largely on narrowband channels wherein\noptimization-based or greedy algorithms were employed to derive hybrid\nbeamformers.

We show\nthat the training reflection matrix design for discrete phase shifts greatly\ndiffers from that for continuous phase shifts, and thus the corresponding\npassive beamforming should be optimized by taking into account the correlated\nchannel estimation error due to discrete phase shifts. Specifically, we\nconsider a practical block-based transmission, where each block has a finite\n(insufficient) number of training symbols for channel estimation. A novel\nhierarchical training reflection design is proposed to progressively estimate\nIRS elements' channels over multiple blocks by exploiting IRS-elements grouping\nand partition. Based on the resolved IRS channels in each block, we further\ndesign the progressive passive beamforming at the IRS with discrete phase\nshifts to improve the achievable rate for data transmission over the blocks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Dec 2019 06:49:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 24 Mar 2020 07:20:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-25", "authors_parsed": [["You", "Changsheng", ""], ["Zheng", "Beixiong", ""], ["Zhang", "Rui", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.10668", "submitter": "Zhen Gao", "authors": "Ziwei Wan, Zhen Gao, Byonghyo Shim, Kai Yang, Guoqiang Mao, and\n  Mohamed-Slim Alouini", "title": "Compressive Sensing Based Channel Estimation for Millimeter-Wave\n  Full-Dimensional MIMO with Lens-Array", "comments": "6 pages, 6 figures, accepted by IEEE Transactions on Vehicular\n  Technology", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT eess.SP math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Channel estimation (CE) for millimeter-wave (mmWave) lens-array suffers from\nprohibitive training overhead, whereas the state-of-the-art solutions require\nan extra complicated radio frequency phase shift network.

Although beamforming can be\ndone in the digital and analog domains, both approaches are hindered by several\nconstraints when it comes to mmWave communications. For example, performing\nfully digital beamforming in mmWave systems involves using many radio frequency\n(RF) chains, which are expensive and consume high power. This necessitates\nfinding more efficient ways for using fewer RF chains while taking advantage of\nthe large antenna arrays. One way to overcome this challenge is to employ\n(partially or fully) analog beamforming through proper configuration of\nphase-shifters.

In this paper, we\npropose a beam design technique that reduces the search time and does not\nrequire CSI while guaranteeing a minimum beamforming gain.

It was observed that for a\ngiven propagation environment (e.g., coverage area of a mmWave BS) the\nazimuthal angles of dominant signals could be more probable from certain angles\nthan others. Thus, pre-collected measurements could used to build a beamforming\ncodebook that regroups the most probable beam designs. We invoke Bayesian\nlearning for measurements clustering.

We extend our prior by proposing two algorithms for adaptively and\nsequentially selecting beamforming vectors for learning of the CSI, and that\nformulate a Bayesian update to account for the time-varying fading model.\nNumerically, we analyze the outage probability and expected spectral efficiency\nof our proposed algorithms and demonstrate improvements over strategies that\nutilize a practical hierarchical codebook.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 Dec 2019 21:31:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Ronquillo", "Nancy", ""], ["Chiu", "Sung-En", ""], ["Javidi", "Tara", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.12748", "submitter": "Ron Roth", "authors": "Ron M.

This joint scheme enabled us to experimentally demonstrate\nthe transmission of 11x218 Gbit/s channels over transatlantic distances at\n5.2bit/4D-sym. Furthermore, a 30% reach increase is demonstrated over PM-8QAM\nand conventional HD-FEC decoding for product codes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Dec 2019 17:16:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Liga", "Gabriele", ""], ["Chen", "Bin", ""], ["van der Heide", "Sjoerd", ""], ["Sheikh", "Alireza", ""], ["van der Hout", "Menno", ""], ["Okonkwo", "Chigo", ""], ["Alvarado", "Alex", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.13463", "submitter": "Kaizheng Wang", "authors": "Kaizheng Wang", "title": "Some compact notations for concentration inequalities and user-friendly\n  results", "comments": "10 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST cs.IT cs.LG math.IT math.PR stat.ML stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents compact notations for concentration inequalities and\nconvenient results to streamline probabilistic analysis.

In this\npaper, we revisit the Deep Variational Information Bottleneck and the\nassumptions needed for its derivation. The two assumed properties of the data\n$X$, $Y$ and their latent representation $T$ take the form of two Markov chains\n$T-X-Y$ and $X-T-Y$. Requiring both to hold during the optimisation process can\nbe limiting for the set of potential joint distributions $P(X,Y,T)$. We\ntherefore show how to circumvent this limitation by optimising a lower bound\nfor $I(T;Y)$ for which only the latter Markov chain has to be satisfied. The\nactual mutual information consists of the lower bound which is optimised in\nDVIB and cognate models in practice and of two terms measuring how much the\nformer requirement $T-X-Y$ is violated. Finally, we propose to interpret the\nfamily of information bottleneck models as directed graphical models and show\nthat in this framework the original and deep information bottlenecks are\nspecial cases of a fundamental IB model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Dec 2019 18:31:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-19", "authors_parsed": [["Wieczorek", "Aleksander", ""], ["Roth", "Volker", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.13493", "submitter": "Melih Bastopcu", "authors": "Melih Bastopcu and Sennur Ulukus", "title": "Age of Information for Updates with Distortion: Constant and\n  Age-Dependent Distortion Constraints", "comments": "Submitted for publication", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.NI eess.SP math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider an information update system where an information receiver\nrequests updates from an information provider in order to minimize its age of\ninformation.

In this problem,\nthere are two entities $E_i$, for $i=1, 2$, each storing a set $\\mathcal{P}_i$,\nwhose elements are picked from a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_K$, on $N_i$\nreplicated and non-colluding databases. It is required to determine the set\nintersection $\\mathcal{P}_1 \\cap \\mathcal{P}_2$ without leaking any information\nabout the remaining elements to the other entity with the least amount of\ndownloaded bits. We first show that the PSI problem can be recast as a\nmulti-message symmetric private information retrieval (MM-SPIR) problem. Next,\nas a stand-alone result, we derive the information-theoretic sum capacity of\nMM-SPIR, $C_{MM-SPIR}$. We show that with $K$ messages, $N$ databases, and the\nsize of the desired message set $P$, the exact capacity of MM-SPIR is\n$C_{MM-SPIR} = 1 - \\frac{1}{N}$ when $P \\leq K-1$, provided that the entropy of\nthe common randomness $S$ satisfies $H(S) \\geq \\frac{P}{N-1}$ per desired\nsymbol. This result implies that there is no gain for MM-SPIR over successive\nsingle-message SPIR (SM-SPIR). For the MM-SPIR problem, we present a novel\ncapacity-achieving scheme that builds on the near-optimal scheme of\nBanawan-Ulukus originally proposed for the multi-message PIR (MM-PIR) problem\nwithout database privacy constraints. Surprisingly, our scheme here is exactly\noptimal for the MM-SPIR problem for any $P$, in contrast to the scheme for the\nMM-PIR problem, which was proved only to be near-optimal. Our scheme is an\nalternative to the SM-SPIR scheme of Sun-Jafar. Based on this capacity result\nfor MM-SPIR, and after addressing the added requirements in its conversion to\nthe PSI problem, we show that the optimal download cost for the PSI problem is\n$\\min\\left\\{\\left\\lceil\\frac{P_1 N_2}{N_2-1}\\right\\rceil, \\left\\lceil\\frac{P_2\nN_1}{N_1-1}\\right\\rceil\\right\\}$, where $P_i$ is the cardinality of set\n$\\mathcal{P}_i$\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Dec 2019 18:51:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 29 Nov 2020 17:17:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-01", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Zhusheng", ""], ["Banawan", "Karim", ""], ["Ulukus", "Sennur", ""]]}]
