In this paper we study the emerging paradigm of sampling and\nreconstructing spatial fields using sensors that move through space. We show\nthat mobile sensing offers some unique advantages over static sensing in\nsensing time-invariant bandlimited spatial fields. Since a moving sensor\nencounters such a spatial field along its path as a time-domain signal, a\ntime-domain anti-aliasing filter can be employed prior to sampling the signal\nreceived at the sensor. Such a filtering procedure, when used by a\nconfiguration of sensors moving at constant speeds along equispaced parallel\nlines, leads to a complete suppression of spatial aliasing in the direction of\nmotion of the sensors. We analytically quantify the advantage of using such a\nsampling scheme over a static sampling scheme by computing the reduction in\nsampling noise due to the filter. We also analyze the effects of non-uniform\nsensor speeds on the reconstruction accuracy. Using simulation examples we\ndemonstrate the advantages of mobile sampling over static sampling in practical\nproblems.\n  We extend our analysis to sampling and reconstruction schemes for monitoring\ntime-varying bandlimited fields using mobile sensors.

To model the scenario in which the sensors operate with\nintermittently available energy that is harvested from the environment, we\npropose that each sensor transmits independently with some probability, and\nadapts the transmit power to its harvested energy.

This fundamental problem has found many recent applications, most\nimportantly in structural biology. We provide a framework to study\nsynchronization as estimation on Riemannian manifolds for arbitrary n under a\nlarge family of noise models. The noise models we address encompass zero-mean\nisotropic noise, and we develop tools for Gaussian-like as well as heavy-tail\ntypes of noise in particular. As a main contribution, we derive the\nCram\\'er-Rao bounds of synchronization, that is, lower-bounds on the variance\nof unbiased estimators. We find that these bounds are structured by the\npseudoinverse of the measurement graph Laplacian, where edge weights are\nproportional to measurement quality. We leverage this to provide interpretation\nin terms of random walks and visualization tools for these bounds in both the\nanchored and anchor-free scenarios. Similar bounds previously established were\nlimited to rotations in the plane and Gaussian-like noise.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Nov 2012 17:57:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 4 Jul 2013 09:33:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-07", "authors_parsed": [["Boumal", "Nicolas", ""], ["Singer", "Amit", ""], ["Absil", "P. -A.", ""], ["Blondel", "Vincent D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.1622", "submitter": "Jinyuan Chen", "authors": "Jinyuan Chen and Petros Elia", "title": "MISO Broadcast Channel with Delayed and Evolving CSIT", "comments": "Submitted to Transactions on Information Theory - November 2012 18\n  double column pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The work considers the two-user MISO broadcast channel with gradual and\ndelayed accumulation of channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT),\nand addresses the question of how much feedback is necessary, and when, in\norder to achieve a certain degrees-of-freedom (DoF) performance.

The notion of instantaneous\ncoupling is included in the definitions. The concept of Granger causality\ngraphs is discussed. We present directed information theory from the\nperspective of studies of causal influences between stochastic processes.\nCausal conditioning appears to be the cornerstone for the relation between\ninformation theory and Granger causality. In the bivariate case, the\nfundamental measure is the directed information, which decomposes as the sum of\nthe transfer entropies and a term quantifying instantaneous coupling. We show\nthe decomposition of the mutual information into the sums of the transfer\nentropies and the instantaneous coupling measure, a relation known for the\nlinear Gaussian case. We study the multivariate case, showing that the useful\ndecomposition is blurred by instantaneous coupling. The links are further\ndeveloped by studying how measures based on directed information theory\nnaturally emerge from Granger causality inference frameworks as hypothesis\ntesting.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 14 Nov 2012 00:13:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Amblard", "Pierre-Olivier", ""], ["Michel", "Olivier J.

It is still not obvious at what demand level more\nsophisticated coordination pays off in terms of total system cost. To make this\ncomparison, we assess the required AP density of three candidate systems for a\ngiven average demand: a Wi-Fi network, a conventional pico-cellular network\nwith frequency planning, and an advanced system employing multi-cell joint\nprocessing. Numerical results show that dense Wi-Fi is the cheapest solution at\na relatively low demand level. However, the AP density grows quickly at a\ncritical demand level regardless of propagation conditions. Beyond this Wi-Fi\nnetwork limit, the conventional pico-cellular network works and is cheaper than\nthe joint processing in obstructed environments, e.g., furnished offices with\nwalls. In line of sight condition such as stadiums, the joint processing\nbecomes the most viable solution. The drawback is that extremely accurate\nchannel state information at transmitters is needed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Nov 2012 12:41:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-20", "authors_parsed": [["Kang", "Du Ho", ""], ["Sung", "Ki Won", ""], ["Zander", "Jens", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.4441", "submitter": "Santhanakrishnan Boopalan", "authors": "B.

Recent advances in fast\nreconfigurable antennas provide new means to alter the statistical profile of\nfading channels and thereby reduce the probability of prolonged fades. Fast\nreconfigurable antennas are therefore poised to improve overall performance,\nespecially for delay-sensitive traffic in slow-fading environments. This\npotential for enhanced performance motivates this study of the temporal\nbehavior of point-to-point communication systems with reconfigurable antennas.\nSpecifically, agile wireless communication schemes over erasure channels are\nanalyzed; situations where using reconfigurable antennas yield substantial\nperformance gains in terms of throughput and average delay are identified.\nScenarios where only partial state information is available at the receiver are\nalso examined, naturally leading to partially observable decision processes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Nov 2012 16:57:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 28 Jan 2014 17:35:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-29", "authors_parsed": [["Kumar", "Santhosh", ""], ["Chamberland", "Jean-Francois", ""], ["Huff", "Gregory H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.6048", "submitter": "Felix Krahmer", "authors": "Felix Krahmer and G\\\"otz Pfander", "title": "Local sampling and approximation of operators with bandlimited\n  Kohn-Nirenberg symbols", "comments": "22 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.FA cs.IT math.CA math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recent sampling theorems allow for the recovery of operators with bandlimited\nKohn-Nirenberg symbols from their response to a single discretely supported\nidentifier signal.

The traffic load in cellular networks exhibits significant\nfluctuations in both space and time, which can be exploited, through cell range\nadaptation, for energy saving.

In this\npaper, we propose a novel secrecy rate enhancing relay strategy that utilizes\nboth frequency and spatial resources, termed as information leakage\nneutralization. To this end, the relay matrix is chosen such that the effective\nchannel from the transmitter to the colluding eavesdropper is equal to the\nnegative of the effective channel over the relay to the colluding eavesdropper\nand thus the information leakage to zero. Interestingly, the optimal relay\nmatrix in general is not block-diagonal which encourages users' encoding over\nthe frequency channels. We proposed two information leakage neutralization\nstrategies, namely efficient information leakage neutralization (EFFIN) and\noptimized information leakage neutralization (OPTIN). EFFIN provides a simple\nand efficient design of relay processing matrix and precoding matrices at the\ntransmitters in the scenario of limited power and computational resources.\nOPTIN, despite its higher complexity, provides a better sum secrecy rate\nperformance by optimizing the relay processing matrix and the precoding\nmatrices jointly.
