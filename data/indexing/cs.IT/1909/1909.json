The proposed algorithm, Group Alternating Direction Method of\nMultipliers (GADMM) is based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers\n(ADMM) framework. The key novelty in GADMM is that it solves the problem in a\ndecentralized topology where at most half of the workers are competing for the\nlimited communication resources at any given time. Moreover, each worker\nexchanges the locally trained model only with two neighboring workers, thereby\ntraining a global model with a lower amount of communication overhead in each\nexchange. We prove that GADMM converges to the optimal solution for convex loss\nfunctions, and numerically show that it converges faster and more\ncommunication-efficient than the state-of-the-art communication-efficient\nalgorithms such as the Lazily Aggregated Gradient (LAG) and dual averaging, in\nlinear and logistic regression tasks on synthetic and real datasets.\nFurthermore, we propose Dynamic GADMM (D-GADMM), a variant of GADMM, and prove\nits convergence under the time-varying network topology of the workers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Aug 2019 19:39:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 28 Jan 2020 10:18:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 24 Mar 2020 12:06:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-25", "authors_parsed": [["Elgabli", "Anis", ""], ["Park", "Jihong", ""], ["Bedi", "Amrit S.", ""], ["Bennis", "Mehdi", ""], ["Aggarwal", "Vaneet", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.00065", "submitter": "MohammadReza Ebrahimi", "authors": "MohammadReza Ebrahimi, Farshad Lahouti, Victoria Kostina", "title": "Two-layer Coded Channel Access with Collision Resolution: Design and\n  Analysis", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.NI math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a two-layer coding architecture for communication of multiple\nusers over a shared slotted medium enabling joint collision resolution and\ndecoding.

The server assists in file delivery by transmitting a\nmessage of size $R$ over a shared error-free link and the goal is to\ncharacterize the optimal rate-memory trade-off. This setup was studied\npreviously by Hachem et al., where an achievable rate and an\ninformation-theoretic lower bound were derived. However, the multiplicative gap\nbetween them was shown to scale linearly with the access degree $L$ and thus\norder-optimality could not be established.\n  A series of recent works have used a natural mapping of the coded caching\nproblem to the well-known index coding problem to derive tighter\ncharacterizations of the optimal rate-memory trade-off under the additional\nassumption that the caches store uncoded content. We follow a similar strategy\nfor the multi-access framework and provide new bounds for the optimal\nrate-memory trade-off $R^*(M)$ over all uncoded placement policies. In\nparticular, we derive a new achievable rate for any $L \\ge 1$ and a new lower\nbound, which works for any uncoded placement policy and $L \\ge K/2$.

Previous work on the\ncase of a single noisy measurement vector has exposed two main challenges: 1) a\nhigh requirement concerning the \\emph{signal-to-noise ratio} ($\\snr$), i.e.,\napproximately of the order of $n^{5}$, and 2) a massive computational burden in\nlight of NP-hardness in general.\n  In this paper, we study the case of \\emph{multiple} noisy measurement vectors\n(MMVs) resulting from a \\emph{common} permutation and investigate to what\nextent the number of MMVs $m$ facilitates permutation recovery by \"borrowing\nstrength\". The above two challenges have at least partially been resolved\nwithin our work. First, we show that a large stable rank of the signal\nsignificantly reduces the required snr which can drop from a polynomial in $n$\nfor $m = 1$ to a constant for $m = \\Omega(\\log n)$, where $m$ denotes the\nnumber of MMVs and $n$ denotes the number of measurements per MV. This bound is\nshown to be sharp and is associated with a phase transition phenomenon. Second,\nwe propose a computational scheme for recovering the unknown permutation in\npractice. For the \"oracle case\" with the known signal, the maximum likelihood\n(ML) estimator reduces to a linear assignment problem whose global optimum can\nbe obtained efficiently. For the case in which both the signal and permutation\nare unknown, the problem is reformulated as a bi-convex optimization problem\nwith an auxiliary variable, which can be solved by the Alternating Direction\nMethod of Multipliers (ADMM). Numerical experiments based on the proposed\ncomputational scheme confirm the tightness of our theoretical analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Sep 2019 15:55:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 11 Jul 2020 05:49:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-14", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Hang", ""], ["Slawski", "Martin", ""], ["Li", "Ping", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.02516", "submitter": "B.Sundar Rajan", "authors": "Shanuja Sasi, V.

This converse is tight in that it coincides with\nthe currently best achievability shown by Fellouris et al.; hence, the optimal\nasymptotic performance of binary BDQCD is characterized. An important\nimplication of this result is that, even with compromised sensors, a 1-bit link\nbetween each sensor and the fusion center suffices to achieve asymptotic\noptimality. To accommodate multiple post-change hypotheses, we then formulate\nthe multi-hypothesis BDQCD problem and again investigate the optimal\nfirst-order performance under different bandwidth constraints. A converse is\nfirst obtained by extending our converse from binary to multi-hypothesis BDQCD.\nTwo families of stopping rules, namely the simultaneous $d$-th alarm and the\nmulti-shot $d$-th alarm, are then proposed. Under sufficient link bandwidth,\nthe simultaneous $d$-th alarm, with $d$ being set to the number of honest\nsensors, can achieve the asymptotic performance that coincides with the derived\nconverse bound; hence, the asymptotically optimal performance of\nmulti-hypothesis BDQCD is again characterized.

For this setting, when $N\\leq K$ we\nshow that our scheme is order optimal within a multiplicative factor of 8.\nFurthermore, when $N > K$ and $M\\geq N/K$, our scheme is order optimal within a\nmultiplicative factor of 4.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 7 Sep 2019 19:36:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-10", "authors_parsed": [["Kamath", "Sneha", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.03392", "submitter": "Sajad Daei Omshi", "authors": "Sajad Daei, Farzan Haddadi, Arash Amini", "title": "Living near the edge: A lower-bound on the phase transition of total\n  variation minimization", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "IEEE transactions on information theory 2019", "doi": "10.1109/TIT.2019.2940673", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This work is about the total variation (TV) minimization which is used for\nrecovering gradient-sparse signals from compressed measurements.

In NOMA, a combination of\nmultiple messages are sent to users, and the defined objective is approached by\nfinding an appropriate power allocation for message signals. To address the\npower allocation problem, two novel methods are proposed. The first one is a\ndivide-and-conquer-based method for which closed-form expressions for the\noptimal resource allocation policy are derived, making this method simple and\nflexible to the system context. The second one is based on the deep\nreinforcement learning method that allows all users to share the full\nbandwidth. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed methods and to compare their performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Sep 2019 17:53:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["Doan", "Khai Nguyen", ""], ["Vaezi", "Mojtaba", ""], ["Shin", "Wonjae", ""], ["Poor", "H.

To\navoid this drawback of DP, we consider datasets containing almost periodic time\nseries, composed of periodic components and noisy variations on top that are\nindependent across periods. Our interest in these datasets is motivated by\nthat, for reporting on private periodic time series, we do not need to divide\nthe privacy budget across the entire, possibly infinite, horizon.
