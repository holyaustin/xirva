Due to the broadcast nature of radio\nwave propagation, the wireless transmission from the sensors to the sink can be\nreadily overheard by the eavesdropper for interception purposes. In an\ninformation-theoretic sense, the secrecy capacity of the wireless transmission\nis the difference between the channel capacity of the main link (from sensor to\nsink) and that of the wiretap link (from sensor to eavesdropper). If the\nsecrecy capacity becomes non-positive due to the wireless fading effect, the\nsensor's data transmission could be successfully intercepted by the\neavesdropper and an intercept event occurs in this case. However, in industrial\nenvironments, the presence of machinery obstacles, metallic frictions and\nengine vibrations makes the wireless fading fluctuate drastically, resulting in\nthe degradation of the secrecy capacity. As a consequence, an optimal sensor\nscheduling scheme is proposed in this paper to protect the legitimate wireless\ntransmission against the eavesdropping attack, where a sensor with the highest\nsecrecy capacity is scheduled to transmit its sensed information to the sink.\nClosed-form expressions of the probability of occurrence of an intercept event\n(called intercept probability) are derived for the conventional round-robin\nscheduling and the proposed optimal scheduling schemes.

We also characterize the\nmaximum risk of the MLE over this nested sequence, and show, for every subset\nin the sequence, that the performance of the minimax rate-optimal estimator\nwith $n$ samples is essentially that of the MLE with $n\\ln n$ samples, thereby\nfurther substantiating the generality of the phenomenon identified by Jiao,\nVenkat, Han, and Weissman.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Feb 2015 23:23:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Jan 2019 19:33:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Han", "Yanjun", ""], ["Jiao", "Jiantao", ""], ["Weissman", "Tsachy", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.00327", "submitter": "Jiantao Jiao", "authors": "Yanjun Han, Jiantao Jiao, Tsachy Weissman", "title": "Does Dirichlet Prior Smoothing Solve the Shannon Entropy Estimation\n  Problem?", "comments": "27 pages, 1 figure, published on IEEE Transactions on Information\n  Theory, merged with https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6959", "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 63, no. 10, pp.\n  6774-6798, Oct. 2017", "doi": "10.1109/TIT.2017.2733537", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Dirichlet prior is widely used in estimating discrete distributions and\nfunctionals of discrete distributions.

The\nscaling arises from comparing the noise level to a restricted isometry constant\nat sparsity $2k$, or equivalently from comparing $2k$ to the so-called\n$\\sigma$-spark of the Fourier system. The proof involves new bounds on the\nsingular values of restricted Fourier matrices, obtained in part from old\ntechniques in complex analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Feb 2015 22:43:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-06", "authors_parsed": [["Demanet", "Laurent", ""], ["Nguyen", "Nam", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.01414", "submitter": "Alexander Barg", "authors": "Itzhak Tamo, Alexander Barg, Sreechakra Goparaju, and Robert\n  Calderbank", "title": "Cyclic LRC Codes and their Subfield Subcodes", "comments": "Submitted for publication", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider linear cyclic codes with the locality property, or locally\nrecoverable codes (LRC codes).

The models are grounded in the\nneuroanatomy and currently known neurophysiology of the worm. The unknown model\nparameters were optimized to reproduce the worm's behavior. Information flow\nanalysis reveals several key principles underlying how the models operate: (1)\nInterneuron class AIY is responsible for integrating information about positive\nand negative changes in concentration, and exhibits a strong left/right\ninformation asymmetry. (2) Gap junctions play a crucial role in the transfer of\ninformation responsible for the information symmetry observed in interneuron\nclass AIZ. (3) Neck motor neuron class SMB implements an information gating\nmechanism that underlies the circuit's state-dependent response. (4) The neck\ncarries non-uniform distribution about changes in concentration. Thus, not all\ndirections of movement are equally informative. Each of these findings\ncorresponds to an experimental prediction that could be tested in the worm to\ngreatly refine our understanding of the neural circuit underlying klinotaxis.\nInformation flow analysis also allows us to explore how information flow\nrelates to underlying electrophysiology.

In this paper, sign least\nmean square algorithm (SLMS) based robust sparse adaptive filtering algorithms\nare proposed for estimating channels as well as for mitigating impulsive noise.\nBy using different sparsity-inducing penalty functions, i.e., zero-attracting\n(ZA), reweighted ZA (RZA), reweighted L1-norm (RL1) and Lp-norm (LP), the\nproposed SLMS algorithms are termed as SLMS-ZA, SLMS-RZA, LSMS-RL1 and SLMS-LP.\nSimulation results are given to validate the proposed algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Feb 2015 07:34:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-20", "authors_parsed": [["Gui", "Guan", ""], ["Xu", "Li", ""], ["Ma", "Wentao", ""], ["Chen", "Badong", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.05507", "submitter": "Umberto Mart\\'inez-Pe\\~nas", "authors": "Olav Geil, Stefano Martin, Umberto Mart\\'inez-Pe\\~nas, Ryutaroh\n  Matsumoto and Diego Ruano", "title": "On asymptotically good ramp secret sharing schemes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "IEICE Trans.

In this paper,\nan autonomous compressive spectrum sensing (ACSS) framework is presented that\nenables a CR to automatically choose the number of measurements while\nguaranteeing the wideband spectrum recovery with a small predictable recovery\nerror. This is realized by the proposed measurement infrastructure and the\nvalidation technique. The proposed ACSS can find a good spectral estimate with\nhigh confidence by using only a small testing subset in both noiseless and\nnoisy environments. Furthermore, a sparsity-aware spectral recovery algorithm\nis proposed to recover the wideband spectrum without requiring knowledge of the\ninstantaneous spectral sparsity level. Such an algorithm bridges the gap\nbetween CS theory and practical spectrum sensing. Simulation results show that\nACSS can not only recover the spectrum using an appropriate number of\nmeasurements, but can also considerably improve the spectral recovery\nperformance compared with existing CS approaches. The proposed recovery\nalgorithm can autonomously adopt a proper number of iterations, therefore\nsolving the problems of under-fitting or over-fitting which commonly exist in\nmost greedy recovery algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Feb 2015 22:55:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Jiang", "Jing", ""], ["Sun", "Hongjian", ""], ["Baglee", "David", ""], ["Poor", "H.

All the sources use channel contention\nto get transmission opportunity.

The\noptimal decision strategies for the two hops are derived in this letter. The\nfirst-hop strategy is a pure-threshold strategy, i.e., when the first-hop\nchannel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is more than a threshold, the winner source\nshould transmit to the relay, and subsequently the second-hop strategy should\nlet the relay keep probing the second-hop channel until a good enough\nsecond-hop channel is observed.

Two natural questions in such a setting are: i)\nGiven a level of sparsity, what is the best approximation to PCA that can be\nachieved? ii) Are there low-order polynomial-time algorithms which can\nasymptotically achieve this optimal tradeoff between the sparsity and the\napproximation quality?\n  In this work, we answer both questions by giving efficient low-order\npolynomial-time algorithms for constructing asymptotically \\emph{optimal}\nlinear auto-encoders (in particular, sparse features with near-PCA\nreconstruction error) and demonstrate the performance of our algorithms on real\ndata.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Feb 2015 21:06:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-25", "authors_parsed": [["Magdon-Ismail", "Malik", ""], ["Boutsidis", "Christos", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.06654", "submitter": "Seong Hwan Kim", "authors": "Seong Hwan Kim, Dan Keun Sung, and Tho Le-Ngoc", "title": "Variable-Length Feedback Codes under a Strict Delay Constraint", "comments": "5pages, 1 figure, Accepted for publication in IEEE Communications\n  Letters", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2398866", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study variable-length feedback (VLF) codes under a strict delay constraint\nto maximize their average transmission rate (ATR) in a discrete memoryless\nchannel (DMC) while considering periodic decoding attempts.

Analytical studies of localization\nperformance (e.g., using the Cram\\'{e}r-Rao lower bound) usually require that\none fix the BS geometry, and favorable geometries have always been the\npreferred choice in the literature. However, not only are the resulting\nanalytical results constrained to the selected geometry, this practice is\nlikely to lead to overly-optimistic expectations of typical localization\nperformance.

Phys. 340(2):575, 2015] recently established\na lower bound on the conditional quantum mutual information (CQMI) of\ntripartite quantum states $ABC$ in terms of the fidelity of recovery (FoR),\ni.e. the maximal fidelity of the state $ABC$ with a state reconstructed from\nits marginal $BC$ by acting only on the $C$ system. The FoR measures quantum\ncorrelations by the local recoverability of global states and has many\nproperties similar to the CQMI. Here we generalize the FoR and show that the\nresulting measure is multiplicative by utilizing semi-definite programming\nduality. This allows us to simplify an operational proof by Brandao et al.\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 115(5):050501, 2015] of the above-mentioned lower bound that\nis based on quantum state redistribution. In particular, in contrast to the\nprevious approaches, our proof does not rely on de Finetti reductions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Feb 2015 17:07:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 29 Mar 2016 11:59:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-30", "authors_parsed": [["Berta", "Mario", ""], ["Tomamichel", "Marco", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.07977", "submitter": "Mark Wilde", "authors": "Mario Berta, Kaushik P.

However,\nhigh resolution and accurate instantaneous frequency (IF) estimation usually\ndepend on the employed distribution and complexity of signal phase function. To\nensure an efficient IF tracking for various types of signals, the class of\ncomplex time distributions has been developed. These distributions facilitate\nanalysis in the cases when standard distributions cannot provide satisfactory\nresults (e.g., for highly nonstationary signal phase). In that sense, an\nambiguity based form of the forth order complex-time distribution is\nconsidered, in a new compressive sensing (CS) context. CS is an intensively\ngrowing approach in signal processing that allows efficient analysis and\nreconstruction of randomly undersampled signals. In this paper, the randomly\nchosen ambiguity domain coefficients serve as CS measurements. By exploiting\nsparsity in the time-frequency plane, it is possible to obtain highly\nconcentrated IF using just small number of random coefficients from ambiguity\ndomain. Moreover, in noisy signal case, this CS approach can be efficiently\ncombined with the L-statistics producing robust time-frequency representations.\nNoisy coefficients are firstly removed using the L-statistics and then\nreconstructed by using CS algorithm. The theoretical considerations are\nillustrated using experimental results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Feb 2015 18:14:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-02", "authors_parsed": [["Orovic", "Irena", ""], ["Draganic", "Andjela", ""], ["Stankovic", "Srdjan", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.07999", "submitter": "Christopher Blake", "authors": "Christopher Blake and Frank R.
