For these new conditions, together with a channel connectivity\n(i.e., interference topology) condition, we show TIN optimality for a new class\nof interference networks that is not included, nor includes, the class found in\n[3].\n  Building on the above insights, we consider the problem of joint link\nscheduling and power control in wireless networks, which has been widely\nstudied as a basic physical layer mechanism for device-to-device (D2D)\ncommunications.

Interactions are often reconstructed using pairwise\nbivariate analyses, overlooking their multivariate nature: it is neglected that\ninvestigating the effect of one source on a target necessitates to take all\nother sources as potential nuisance variables into account; also combinations\nof sources may act jointly on a given target. Bivariate analyses produce\nnetworks that may contain spurious interactions, which reduce the\ninterpretability of the network and its graph metrics. A truly multivariate\nreconstruction, however, is computationally intractable due to combinatorial\nexplosion in the number of potential interactions. Thus, we have to resort to\napproximative methods to handle the intractability of multivariate interaction\nreconstruction, and thereby enable the use of networks in neuroscience. Here,\nwe suggest such an approximative approach in the form of an algorithm that\nextends fast bivariate interaction reconstruction by identifying potentially\nspurious interactions post-hoc: the algorithm flags potentially spurious edges,\nwhich may then be pruned from the network. This produces a statistically\nconservative network approximation that is guaranteed to contain non-spurious\ninteractions only. We describe the algorithm and present a reference\nimplementation to test its performance. We discuss the algorithm in relation to\nother approximative multivariate methods and highlight suitable application\nscenarios.

In this paper, as a benchmark for these NC methods, we derive the\nclosed-form deterministic R-D NC Cramer-Rao bound (NC CRB) for the\nmulti-dimensional parameter estimation of strictly non-circular (rectilinear)\nsignal sources. Assuming a separable centro-symmetric R-D array, we show that\nin some special cases, the deterministic R-D NC CRB reduces to the existing\ndeterministic R-D CRB for arbitrary signals. This suggests that no gain from\nstrictly non-circular sources (NC gain) can be achieved in these cases. For\nmore general scenarios, finding an analytical expression of the NC gain for an\narbitrary number of sources is very challenging. Thus, in this paper, we\nsimplify the derived NC CRB and the existing CRB for the special case of two\nclosely-spaced strictly non-circular sources captured by a uniform linear array\n(ULA). Subsequently, we use these simplified CRB expressions to analytically\ncompute the maximum achievable asymptotic NC gain for the considered two source\ncase.

The underlying idea of this algorithm is\nto closely approximate the rank function with a smooth function of singular\nvalues, and then minimize the resulting approximation subject to the linear\nconstraints. The accuracy of the approximation is controlled via a scaling\nparameter $\\delta$, where a smaller $\\delta$ corresponds to a more accurate\nfitting. The consequent optimization problem for any finite $\\delta$ is\nnonconvex. Therefore, in order to decrease the risk of ending up in local\nminima, a series of optimizations is performed, starting with optimizing a\nrough approximation (a large $\\delta$) and followed by successively optimizing\nfiner approximations of the rank with smaller $\\delta$'s. To solve the\noptimization problem for any $\\delta > 0$, it is converted to a new program in\nwhich the cost is a function of two auxiliary positive semidefinete variables.\nThe paper shows that this new program is concave and applies a\nmajorize-minimize technique to solve it which, in turn, leads to a few convex\noptimization iterations. This optimization scheme is also equivalent to a\nreweighted Nuclear Norm Minimization (NNM), where weighting update depends on\nthe used approximating function. For any $\\delta > 0$, we derive a necessary\nand sufficient condition for the exact recovery which are weaker than those\ncorresponding to NNM.

The key advantages of these estimators are twofold. First,\nthey guarantee by construction a good conditioning of the estimate and second,\nbeing a derivative of robust Tyler estimators, they inherit their robustness\nproperties, notably their resilience to the presence of outliers. Nevertheless,\none major problem that poses the use of RTEs in practice is represented by the\nquestion of setting the regularization parameter $\\rho$. While a high value of\n$\\rho$ is likely to push all the eigenvalues away from zero, it comes at the\ncost of a larger bias with respect to the population covariance matrix. A deep\nunderstanding of the statistics of RTEs is essential to come up with\nappropriate choices for the regularization parameter. This is not an easy task\nand might be out of reach, unless one considers asymptotic regimes wherein the\nnumber of observations $n$ and/or their size $N$ increase together.

Consider a multi-cloud radio access\nnetwork, where each cloud is connected to several base-stations (BSs) via high\ncapacity links, and therefore allows joint signal processing between them.\nAcross the multiple clouds, however, only scheduling-level coordination is\npermitted, as it requires a lower level of backhaul communication.

The paper addresses the\nproblem of maximizing a network-wide utility by associating users to clouds and\nscheduling them to the PZs, under the practical constraints that each user is\nscheduled, at most, to a single cloud, but possibly to many BSs within the\ncloud, and can be served by one or more distinct PZs within the BSs' frame. The\npaper solves the problem using graph theory techniques by constructing the\nconflict graph.

The schemes improve over the noisy network coding proposed by Lim et\nal.. For the single relay channel with relay-transmitter feedback, our coding\nschemes recover Gabbai and Bross's results, and strictly improve on noisy\nnetwork coding, distributed decode-forward coding proposed by Lim et al., and\nall known lower bounds on the achievable rates proposed for the setup without\nfeedback.\n  The coding schemes are based on block-Markov coding, superposition coding,\nsliding-window/backward decoding and hybrid relaying strategies. In our Scheme\n1A, the relays and receivers use compress-forward strategy and send the\ncompression indices to the transmitter through the feedback pipes. After\nobtaining the compression indices through feedback, the transmitter sends them\ntogether with the source message. Each receiver uses backward decoding to\njointly decode the source message and all compression indices. Our Scheme 1B is\nsimilar, except that here each relay not only uses compress forward to compress\nits channel outputs, but also performs partial decode forward to decode a\ncommon part of source message. Our Scheme 1C allows different relays to decode\ndifferent parts of the source message (in Scheme 1A, no relay decodes any part\nof the source message; in Scheme 1B, all relays decode the same part of source\nmessage), which can achieve higher rates than Scheme 1A and Scheme 1B.\n  Motivated by the feedback coding scheme, we propose a new coding scheme for\nDM-MN without feedback, where the transmitter decodes the compression indices\ninstead of obtaining them directly through feedback.

Most of the works that have looked at this\nproblem have focused on using the value of the signal observed at a subset of\nnodes to recover the signal in the entire graph. Differently, the sampling\nscheme proposed here uses as input observations taken at a single node. The\nobservations correspond to sequential applications of the graph-shift operator,\nwhich are linear combinations of the information gathered by the neighbors of\nthe node. When the graph corresponds to a directed cycle (which is the support\nof time-varying signals), our method is equivalent to the classical sampling in\nthe time domain. When the graph is more general, we show that the Vandermonde\nstructure of the sampling matrix, which is critical to guarantee recovery when\nsampling time-varying signals, is preserved. Sampling and interpolation are\nanalyzed first in the absence of noise and then noise is considered.

Stochastic resonance (SR) has been identified to have the\npotential to tackle this problem, namely to enable non-linear systems to detect\nsmall, otherwise sub-threshold signals by means of added non-zero noise. This\nhas been demonstrated within a wide range of systems in physical, technological\nand biological contexts. Based on its ubiquitous importance, numerous\ntheoretical and technical approaches aim at an optimization of signal\ntransduction based on SR.

The fundamental shortcoming with all these measures is that\nknowledge of the signal to be detected is required to compute them.

We also develop a general outer bound, which relies on a\nstrong data processing inequality to effectively capture the senders\nuncertainty about the users' side information. Additionally, we consider the\ncase where communication takes place over a shared wireless medium, modeled by\nan erasure broadcast channel, and show that surprisingly, combining repetition\ncoding with hybrid coding improves the achievable rate region and outperforms\nalternative strategies of coping with channel erasure and while blindly\nexploiting side information.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Apr 2015 01:04:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 26 May 2015 16:04:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 1 Sep 2015 06:28:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Kao", "David T.

However, the upcoming wireless systems, notably the\n5G system, will need to support novel traffic types that use short packets. For\nexample, short packets represent the most common form of traffic generated by\nsensors and other devices involved in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications.\nFurthermore, there are emerging applications in which small packets are\nexpected to carry critical information that should be received with low latency\nand ultra-high reliability.\n  Current wireless systems are not designed to support short-packet\ntransmissions. For example, the design of current systems relies on the\nassumption that the metadata (control information) is of negligible size\ncompared to the actual information payload. Hence, transmitting metadata using\nheuristic methods does not affect the overall system performance. However, when\nthe packets are short, metadata may be of the same size as the payload, and the\nconventional methods to transmit it may be highly suboptimal.\n  In this article, we review recent advances in information theory, which\nprovide the theoretical principles that govern the transmission of short\npackets.

This technique is known as digital backpropagation. Typical\ndigital backpropagation algorithms are based on split-step Fourier methods in\nwhich the signal has to be discretized in time and space. The need to\ndiscretize in both time and space however makes the real-time implementation of\ndigital backpropagation a challenging problem. In this paper, a new fast\nalgorithm for digital backpropagation based on nonlinear Fourier transforms is\npresented. Aiming at a proof of concept, the main emphasis will be put on\nfibers with normal dispersion in order to avoid the issue of solitonic\ncomponents in the signal. However, it is demonstrated that the algorithm also\nworks for anomalous dispersion if the signal power is low enough. Since the\nspatial evolution of a signal governed by the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation\ncan be reverted analytically in the nonlinear Fourier domain through simple\nphase-shifts, there is no need to discretize the spatial domain. The proposed\nalgorithm requires only $\\mathcal{O}(D\\log^{2}D)$ floating point operations to\nbackpropagate a signal given by $D$ samples, independently of the fiber's\nlength, and is therefore highly promising for real-time implementations.

We further\nanalyze in detail the independent partial DF scheme and derive in closed-form\nlink regimes when this scheme achieves a strictly larger rate region than just\ntime-sharing between its constituent techniques, direct transmission and\nindependent DF relaying, and when it reduces to a simpler scheme. For the\nhalf-duplex mode, we propose a 6-phase time-division scheme that incorporates\nall considered relaying techniques and uses joint decoding simultaneously over\nall receiving phases.

We show that the dependence of the rate function on the stochastic\nweight matrix associated with the network is fully captured by its left\neigenvector corresponding to the unit eigenvalue. Further, when the sensors'\nobservations are Gaussian, the rate function admits a closed form expression.\nMotivated by these observations, we formulate the optimal network design\nproblem of finding the left eigenvector which achieves the highest value of the\nrate function, for a given target accuracy. This eigenvector therefore\nminimizes the time that the inference algorithm needs to reach the desired\naccuracy.

We prove that\nthis fundamental property holds even when the topology and the associated\nsystem matrices change randomly over time, with arbitrary distribution.

However, with the advent of cheap\nmemory and smart caching, this traditional paradigm can converge into a single\nsystem which can provide both services in an efficient manner. This paper\nfocuses on multimedia delivery through an integrated network, including both a\ncellular (also known as unicast or broadband) and a broadcast last mile\noperating over shared spectrum. The subscribers of the network are equipped\nwith a cache which can effectively create zero perceived latency for multimedia\ndelivery, assuming that the content has been proactively and intelligently\ncached. The main objective of this work is to establish analytically the\noptimal content popularity threshold, based on a intuitive cost function. In\nother words, the aim is to derive which content should be broadcasted and which\ncontent should be unicasted. To facilitate this, Cooperative Multi- Point\n(CoMP) joint processing algorithms are employed for the uni and broad-cast PHY\ntransmissions. To practically implement this, the integrated network controller\nis assumed to have access to traffic statistics in terms of content popularity.\nSimulation results are provided to assess the gain in terms of total spectral\nefficiency.

In this paper, the problem of energy detection (ED)\nof an unknown signal over Nakagami-$m$ fading is revisited. Specifically, an\nanalytical expression for the local probability of detection is derived, while\nusing the approach of ED at the individual secondary user (SU), a new fusion\nrule, based on the likelihood ratio test, is presented. The channels between\nthe primary user to SUs and SUs to fusion center are considered to be\nindependent Nakagami-$m$. The proposed fusion rule uses the channel statistics,\ninstead of the instantaneous channel state information, and is based on the\nNeyman-Pearson criteria. Closed-form solutions for the system-level probability\nof detection and probability of false alarm are also derived. Furthermore, a\nclosed-form expression for the optimal number of cooperative SUs, needed to\nminimize the total error rate, is presented. The usefulness of factor graph and\nsum-product-algorithm models for computing likelihoods, is also discussed to\nhighlight its advantage, in terms of computational cost. The performance of the\nproposed schemes have been evaluated both by analysis and simulations.
