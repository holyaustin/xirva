The problem setup includes a database of $K$\nindependent messages possibly replicated on several servers, and a user that\nneeds to retrieve one of these messages. In addition, the user has some prior\nside information in the form of a subset of $M$ messages, not containing the\ndesired message and unknown to the servers. This problem is motivated by\npractical settings in which the user can obtain side information\nopportunistically from other users or has previously downloaded some messages\nusing classical PIR schemes. The objective of the user is to retrieve the\nrequired message without revealing its identity while minimizing the amount of\ndata downloaded from the servers.\n  We focus on achieving information-theoretic privacy in two scenarios: (i) the\nuser wants to protect jointly its demand and side information; (ii) the user\nwants to protect only the information about its demand, but not the side\ninformation. To highlight the role of side information, we focus first on the\ncase of a single server (single database). In the first scenario, we prove that\nthe minimum download cost is $K-M$ messages, and in the second scenario it is\n$\\lceil \\frac{K}{M+1}\\rceil$ messages, which should be compared to $K$\nmessages, the minimum download cost in the case of no side information. Then,\nwe extend some of our results to the case of the database replicated on\nmultiple servers. Our proof techniques relate PIR with side information to the\nindex coding problem.

We formulate the problem of finding a\nspectrum sensing policy for multi-band dynamic spectrum access as a stochastic\nrestless multi-armed bandit problem with stationary unknown reward\ndistributions. In cognitive radio networks the multi-armed bandit problem\narises when deciding where in the radio spectrum to look for idle frequencies\nthat could be efficiently exploited for data transmission.

The policy proposed in this paper is an\nindex policy, in which the index of a frequency band is comprised of a sample\nmean term and a recency-based exploration bonus term. The sample mean promotes\nspectrum exploitation whereas the exploration bonus encourages for further\nexploration for idle bands providing high data rates. The proposed recency\nbased approach readily allows constructing the exploration bonus such that it\nwill grow the time interval between consecutive sensing time instants of a\nsuboptimal band exponentially, which then leads to logarithmically increasing\nweak regret.

Advanced recent research activities are comprehensively reviewed\nand intriguing future research directions are actively discussed, along with\nthe identifications of a range of challenges, both for enhancing the\nestablished applications and for stimulating the emerging applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Sep 2017 17:08:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-07", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Rong", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.02023", "submitter": "Murat Kocaoglu", "authors": "Murat Kocaoglu, Christopher Snyder, Alexandros G.

Moreover, we also propose a hybrid analog and digital\nprecoding scheme for SE maximization. More specifically, a closed-form lower\nbound is firstly derived to quantify the achievable SE of the proposed system.\nBy utilizing this lower bound as the cost function, a two-step algorithm is\nproposed to optimize the hybrid precoder. The proposed algorithm not only\nutilizes the concavity of the cost function over the digital power allocation\nvector, but also invokes the convex $\\ell_\\infty$ relaxation to handle the\nnon-convex constraint imposed by analog precoding. Finally, the proposed scheme\nis shown via simulations to outperform state-of-the-art mmWave MIMO schemes in\nterms of achievable SE.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Sep 2017 04:16:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-11", "authors_parsed": [["He", "Longzhuang", ""], ["Wang", "Jintao", ""], ["Song", "Jian", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.02582", "submitter": "Yuxuan Sun", "authors": "Yuxuan Sun, Sheng Zhou and Jie Xu", "title": "EMM: Energy-Aware Mobility Management for Mobile Edge Computing in Ultra\n  Dense Networks", "comments": "14 pages, 6 figures, an extended version of the paper submitted to\n  IEEE JSAC", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.NI math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Merging mobile edge computing (MEC) functionality with the dense deployment\nof base stations (BSs) provides enormous benefits such as a real proximity, low\nlatency access to computing resources.

Based on the analytic results,\nwe then consider the area spectrum efficiency maximization by optimizing design\nparameters, which is a complicated mixed-integer optimization problem. After\nanalyzing the optimal properties, we obtain a local optimal solution with lower\ncomplexity. To further simplify the optimization, we then solve an asymptotic\noptimization problem in the high user density region, using the upper bound as\nthe objective function. Numerical simulations show that the asymptotic optimal\ncaching scheme achieves better performance over existing caching schemes. The\nanalysis and optimization results provide insightful design guidelines for\nrandom caching in practical networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Sep 2017 07:42:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-20", "authors_parsed": [["Kuang", "Sufeng", ""], ["Liu", "Nan", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.06281", "submitter": "Ali Tebbi", "authors": "Ali Tebbi and Chi Wan Sung", "title": "Coded Caching in Partially Cooperative D2D Communication Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The backhaul traffic is becoming a major concern in wireless and cellular\nnetworks (e.g., 4G-LTE and 5G) with the increasing demands for online video\nstreaming.

By exploiting the fact that the degrees of freedom of\nthe physical channel matrix are smaller than the number of free parameters, the\nchannel estimation and faulty antenna detection can be formulated as an\nextended atomic norm denoising problem and solved efficiently via the\nalternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Furthermore, we improve the\ncomputational efficiency by proposing a fast algorithm and show that it is a\ngood approximation of the corresponding extended atomic norm minimization\nmethod.

Namely, there exists a fundamental\ntradeoff between the coverage and link rate in mmWave HetNets with distinct\nbandwidths in the UHF and mmWave bands while a user is associating with a BS.\nWe characterize the coverage-optimal and rate-optimal user association schemes\nand numerically validate their performances and show the coverage-rate tradeoff\nproblem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Sep 2017 02:25:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 26 Sep 2017 11:49:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:09:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 19 Apr 2018 13:39:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 24 Apr 2018 19:46:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Thu, 28 Jun 2018 22:09:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Tue, 2 Oct 2018 14:56:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v8", "created": "Tue, 20 Nov 2018 02:41:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-21", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Chun-Hung", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.08216", "submitter": "Ankit Singh Rawat", "authors": "Ankit Singh Rawat and Itzhak Tamo and Venkatesan Guruswami and Klim\n  Efremenko", "title": "MDS Code Constructions with Small Sub-packetization and Near-optimal\n  Repair Bandwidth", "comments": "Significant overlap with arXiv:1608.00191", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.CC math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper addresses the problem of constructing MDS codes that enable exact\nrepair of each code block with small repair bandwidth, which refers to the\ntotal amount of information flow from the remaining code blocks during the\nrepair process. This problem naturally arises in the context of distributed\nstorage systems as the node repair problem [7]. The constructions of\nexact-repairable MDS codes with optimal repair-bandwidth require working with\nlarge sub-packetization levels, which restricts their employment in practice.\n  This paper presents constructions for MDS codes that simultaneously provide\nboth small repair bandwidth and small sub-packetization level. In particular,\nthis paper presents two general approaches to construct exact-repairable MDS\ncodes that aim at significantly reducing the required sub-packetization level\nat the cost of slightly sub-optimal repair bandwidth. The first approach gives\nMDS codes that have repair bandwidth at most twice the optimal\nrepair-bandwidth. Additionally, these codes also have the smallest possible\nsub-packetization level $\\ell = O(r)$, where $r$ denotes the number of parity\nblocks. This approach is then generalized to design codes that have their\nrepair bandwidth approaching the optimal repair-bandwidth at the cost of\ngraceful increment in the required sub-packetization level. The second approach\ntransforms an MDS code with optimal repair-bandwidth and large\nsub-packetization level into a longer MDS code with small sub-packetization\nlevel and near-optimal repair bandwidth. For a given $r$, the obtained codes\nhave their sub-packetization level scaling logarithmically with the code\nlength. In addition, the obtained codes require field size only linear in the\ncode length and ensure load balancing among the intact code blocks in terms of\nthe information downloaded from these blocks during the exact reconstruction of\na code block.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Sep 2017 16:21:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-26", "authors_parsed": [["Rawat", "Ankit Singh", ""], ["Tamo", "Itzhak", ""], ["Guruswami", "Venkatesan", ""], ["Efremenko", "Klim", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.08224", "submitter": "Pranav Kumar Jha", "authors": "Pranav Kumar Jha, S Sushmitha Shree and D.

Our proof technique straightforwardly generalizes and allows to\nrigorously obtain the mutual information at any order in a recursive way.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Sep 2017 12:32:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 10 Oct 2017 11:46:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 27 Nov 2018 16:51:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-28", "authors_parsed": [["Barbier", "Jean", ""], ["Macris", "Nicolas", ""], ["Miolane", "L\u00e9o", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.10371", "submitter": "Meryem Benammar", "authors": "Meryem Benammar, Valerio Bioglio, Frederic Gabry, Ingmar Land", "title": "Multi-Kernel Polar Codes: Proof of Polarization and Error Exponents", "comments": "Accepted and to be presented at ITW 2017, Kaohsiung", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we investigate a novel family of polar codes based on\nmulti-kernel constructions, proving that this construction actually polarizes.\nTo this end, we derive a new and more general proof of polarization, which\ngives sufficient conditions for kernels to polarize.

Two different computation methods for these AIRs are also discussed:\nMonte-Carlo integration and Gauss-Hermite quadrature.
