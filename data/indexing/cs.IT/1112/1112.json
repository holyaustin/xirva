While a diversity gain from joint sparsity had been demonstrated\nearlier in the case of a convex relaxation method using an $l_1/l_2$ mixed norm\npenalty, only recently was it shown that similar diversity gain can be achieved\nby greedy algorithms if we combine greedy steps with a MUSIC-like subspace\ncriterion. However, the main limitation of these hybrid algorithms is that they\noften require a large number of snapshots or a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nfor an accurate subspace as well as partial support estimation. One of the main\ncontributions of this work is to show that the noise robustness of these\nalgorithms can be significantly improved by allowing sequential subspace\nestimation and support filtering, even when the number of snapshots is\ninsufficient. Numerical simulations show that a novel sequential compressive\nMUSIC (sequential CS-MUSIC) that combines the sequential subspace estimation\nand support filtering steps significantly outperforms the existing greedy\nalgorithms and is quite comparable with computationally expensive state-of-art\nalgorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Dec 2011 08:27:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 15 May 2012 04:40:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Jong Min", ""], ["Lee", "Ok Kyun", ""], ["Ye", "Jong Chul", ""]]}, {"id": "1112.3471", "submitter": "Girish Nair", "authors": "Girish N.

The aim of this paper is to significantly strengthen these\nresults by showing that interference alignment can be used to characterize\ncapacity to within a constant gap. We focus on real, time-invariant,\nfrequency-flat X-channels.

The relay is used to manage the\ninterference at the receivers. It is assumed that all nodes including the relay\nhave channel state information only for their own links and that the relay has\nM (greater than or equal to K) antennas in a K-user network. We pose the\nquestion: What is the benefit of exploiting the direct links from the source to\ndestinations compared to a simpler two-hop strategy. To answer this question,\nwe first establish the degrees of freedom of the interference channel with a\nMIMO relay, showing that a K-pair network with a MIMO relay has K/2 degrees of\nfreedom. Thus, appropriate signaling in a two-hop scenario captures the degrees\nof freedom without the need for the direct links. We then consider more\nsophisticated encoding strategies in search of other ways to exploit the direct\nlinks. Using a number of hybrid encoding strategies, we obtain non-asymptotic\nachievable sum-rates. We investigate the case where the relay (unlike other\nnodes) has access to abundant power, showing that when sources have power P and\nthe relay is allowed power proportional to O(P^2), the full degrees of freedom\nK are available to the network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 24 Dec 2011 21:30:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["Tannious", "Ramy Abdallah", ""], ["Nosratinia", "Aria", ""]]}, {"id": "1112.5767", "submitter": "Muhammad Nazmul Islam", "authors": "Muhammad Nazmul Islam, Narayan Mandayam and Sastry Kompella", "title": "Optimal Resource Allocation and Relay Selection in Bandwidth Exchange\n  Based Cooperative Forwarding", "comments": "8 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": "Proceedings of WiOpt 2012 (Page 192-199)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we investigate joint optimal relay selection and resource\nallocation under bandwidth exchange (BE) enabled incentivized cooperative\nforwarding in wireless networks.
