It is empirically shown\nthat, at high signal-to-noise-ratios, the phase estimation error is small. To\nreduce the amplitude estimation error, we restrict the minimizer to be drawn\nfrom the so-called phase noise geometry set when minimizing the cost function.\nThe resulting optimization problem is a non-convex program. However, using the\nS-procedure for quadratic equalities, we show that the optimal solution can be\nobtained by solving the convex dual problem.

Compared to conventional convex optimization\nmethods, it has a much lower complexity and is computationally tractable. In\nthe GAMP framework, the sparse signal and the observation are viewed to be\ngenerated according to some pre-specified probability distributions in the\ninput and output channels. However, the parameters of the distributions are\nusually unknown in practice. In this paper, we propose an extended GAMP\nalgorithm with built-in parameter estimation (PE-GAMP) and present its\nempirical convergence analysis. PE-GAMP treats the parameters as unknown random\nvariables with simple priors and jointly estimates them with the sparse\nsignals. Compared with Expectation Maximization (EM) based parameter estimation\nmethods, the proposed PE-GAMP could draw information from the prior\ndistributions of the parameters to perform parameter estimation. It is also\nmore robust and much simpler, which enables us to consider more complex signal\ndistributions apart from the usual Bernoulli-Gaussian (BGm) mixture\ndistribution. Specifically, the formulations of Bernoulli-Exponential mixture\n(BEm) distribution and Laplace distribution are given in this paper. Simulated\nnoiseless sparse signal recovery experiments demonstrate that the performance\nof the proposed PE-GAMP matches the oracle GAMP algorithm. When noise is\npresent, both the simulated experiments and the real image recovery experiments\nshow that PE-GAMP is still able to maintain its robustness and outperform EM\nbased parameter estimation method when the sampling ratio is small.\nAdditionally, using the BEm formulation of the PE-GAMP, we can successfully\nperform non-negative sparse coding of local image patches and provide useful\nfeatures for the image classification task.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Jun 2016 21:17:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 6 Sep 2016 21:33:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 11 Jan 2017 16:38:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-12", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Shuai", ""], ["Tran", "Trac D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.00933", "submitter": "Leyuan Pan", "authors": "Leyuan Pan and Yongyu Dai and Wei Xu and Xiaodai Dong", "title": "Multipair Massive MIMO Relaying with Pilot-Data Transmission Overlay", "comments": "13 pages, 8 figures, journal", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a pilot-data transmission overlay scheme for multipair massive\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relaying systems employing either half-\nor full-duplex (HD or FD) communications at the relay station (RS).

However, such\ndistributed operation of the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer leads to\nsub-optimal utilization of the shared channel. One of the reasons is the\noccurrence of collisions when more than one packet is transmitted at the same\ntime. These packets cannot be decoded and retransmissions are necessary.\nHowever, it has been recently shown that it is possible to apply signal\nprocessing techniques with these collided packets so that useful information\ncan be decoded. This was recently proposed in the Irregular Repetition Slotted\nALOHA (IRSA), achieving a throughput $T \\simeq 0.97$ for very large MAC frame\nlengths as long as the number of active users is smaller than the number of\nslots per frame. In this paper, we extend the operation of IRSA with i) an\niterative physical layer decoding processing that exploits the capture effect\nand ii) a Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) processing at the\nslot-level, named intra-slot SIC, to decode more than one colliding packet per\nslot. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, referred to as\nExtended IRSA (E-IRSA), in terms of throughput and channel capacity.\nComputer-based simulation results show that E-IRSA protocol allows to reach the\nmaximum theoretical achievable throughput even in scenarios where the number of\nactive users is higher than the number of slots per frame. Results also show\nthat E-IRSA protocol significantly improves the performance even for small MAC\nframe lengths used in practical scenarios.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Jun 2016 21:03:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-08", "authors_parsed": [["Interdonato", "G.", ""], ["Pfletschinger", "S.", ""], ["Vazquez-Gallego", "F.", ""], ["Alonso-Zarate", "J.", ""], ["Araniti", "G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.01943", "submitter": "Giovanni Interdonato", "authors": "G.

If in a certain instant at most d<=k active stations transmit to the\nchannel then their messages are successfully transmitted, whereas if more than\nd active stations transmit simultaneously then their messages are lost.

The measure to optimize is the number of time slots\nneeded to solve conflicts among all active stations. The fundamental question\nis whether this measure decreases linearly with the number d of messages that\ncan be simultaneously transmitted with success.

First, a numerical analysis of the additive\nwhite Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel investigates the effect of using a small\nnumber of input probability mass functions (PMFs) for a range of\nsignal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), instead of optimizing the constellation shaping\nfor each SNR. It is shown that if a small penalty of at most 0.1 dB SNR to the\nfull shaping gain is acceptable, just two shaped PMFs are required per\nquadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) over a large SNR range. For a multi-span\nwavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical fiber system with 64QAM input,\nit is shown that just one PMF is required to achieve large gains over uniform\ninput for distances from 1,400 km to 3,000 km. Using recently developed\ntheoretical models that extend the Gaussian noise (GN) model and full-field\nsplit-step simulations, we illustrate the ramifications of probabilistic\nshaping on the effective SNR after fiber propagation. Our results show that,\nfor a fixed average optical launch power, a shaping gain is obtained for the\nnoise contributions from fiber amplifiers and modulation-independent nonlinear\ninterference (NLI), whereas shaping simultaneously causes a penalty as it leads\nto an increased NLI. However, this nonlinear shaping loss is found to have a\nrelatively minor impact, and optimizing the shaped PMF with a\nmodulation-dependent GN model confirms that the PMF found for AWGN is also a\ngood choice for a multi-span fiber system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 Jun 2016 19:14:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 28 Jul 2016 11:23:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Fehenberger", "Tobias", ""], ["Alvarado", "Alex", ""], ["B\u00f6cherer", "Georg", ""], ["Hanik", "Norbert", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.04142", "submitter": "Jean Barbier", "authors": "Jean Barbier, Mohamad Dia, Nicolas Macris, Florent Krzakala, Thibault\n  Lesieur, Lenka Zdeborova", "title": "Mutual information for symmetric rank-one matrix estimation: A proof of\n  the replica formula", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 29 (NIPS 2016)\n  pp 424-432", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cond-mat.dis-nn cs.LG math-ph math.IT math.MP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Factorizing low-rank matrices has many applications in machine learning and\nstatistics.

Our\nanalysis shows that the optimal design can be achieved in two steps. The first\nstep is to maximize a new objective that can simultaneously maximize both WET\nand WIT, considering both the smart grid profitable and smart grid neutral\ncases.

Instead, one\nhas access to multiple corrupted versions of the signal. The available\ncorrupted signals are correlated because they carry information about the\ncommon remote signal. The goal is to reconstruct the original signal from the\ndata collected from its corrupted versions. The information theoretic\nformulation of the remote reconstruction problem assumes that the corrupted\nsignals are uniformly sampled and the focus is on optimal compression of the\nsamples.

In finding\nthe sampling locations, one can take advantage of the correlation among the\ncorrupted signals.

Furthermore, it is tight and\nmatches the optimal reconstruction distortion in low and high sampling rates.\nMoreover, it is shown that in the low sampling rate region, it is optimal to\nuse a certain nonuniform sampling scheme on all the signals.

In such scenario, the\ninterfering signals are confined to one sub-space and the intended signal is\nconfined to the other sub-space.

Recent works have started to\ninvestigate the possibility to use receivers based on energy detection (ED),\nwhere a single data stream is decoded based on the channel and noise energy.\nThe asymptotic features of the massive receiver array lead to a system where\nthe impact of the noise becomes predictable due to a noise hardening effect.\nThis in effect extends the communication range compared to the receiver with a\nsmall number of antennas, as the latter is limited by the unpredictability of\nthe additive noise. When the channel has a large number of spatial degrees of\nfreedom, the system becomes robust to imperfect channel knowledge due to\nchannel hardening. We propose two detection methods based on the instantaneous\nand average channel energy, respectively. Meanwhile, we design the detection\nthresholds based on the asymptotic properties of the received energy.\nDifferently from existing works, we analyze the scaling law behavior of the\nsymbol-error-rate (SER). When the instantaneous channel energy is known, the\nperformance of ED approaches that of the coherent detection in high SNR\nscenarios.

After demonstrating the high computational complexity of the ML\nestimator, a median based (MB) estimator with proved low complexity is then\nproposed. Furthermore, the estimation accuracy of the MB estimation is\ntheoretically characterized. By comparing the ML estimator and the MB estimator\nfrom the aspects of the computational complexity as well as the estimation\naccuracy, both advantages and disadvantages of two estimators are revealed.\nNumerical results show that the estimation errors of the ML estimator and the\nMB estimator can be as small as $0.6$ dB and $0.7$ dB, respectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Jun 2016 12:11:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 15 Sep 2016 01:59:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 27 Nov 2016 07:29:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-29", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Lin", ""], ["Zhao", "Guodong", ""], ["Zhou", "Wenli", ""], ["Li", "Liying", ""], ["Wu", "Gang", ""], ["Liang", "Ying-Chang", ""], ["Li", "Shaoqian", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.06992", "submitter": "Anibal Sanjab", "authors": "Anibal Sanjab, Walid Saad, Ismail Guvenc, Arif Sarwat, Saroj Biswas", "title": "Smart Grid Security: Threats, Challenges, and Solutions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.GT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The cyber-physical nature of the smart grid has rendered it vulnerable to a\nmultitude of attacks that can occur at its communication, networking, and\nphysical entry points.

Under the former strategy, each user's\nmessage is multicast from the central processor (CP) to all the serving remote\nradio heads (RRHs) over the fronthaul network, which then cooperatively serve\nthe users through joint beamforming; while under the latter strategy, the user\nmessages are first beamformed then quantized at the CP, and the compressed\nsignal is unicast to the corresponding RRH, which then decompresses its\nreceived signal for wireless transmission. Previous works show that in general\nthe compression-based strategy outperforms the data-sharing strategy. This\npaper, on the other hand, point s out that in a C-RAN model where the RRHs are\nconnected to the CP via multi-hop routers, data-sharing can be superior to\ncompression if the network coding technique is adopted for multicasting user\nmessages to the cooperating RRHs, and the RRH's beamforming vectors, the\nuser-RRH association, and the network coding design over the fronthaul network\nare jointly optimized based on the techniques of sparse optimization an d\nsuccessive convex approximation. This is in comparison to the compression-based\nstrategy, where information is unicast over the fronthaul network by simple\nrouting, and the RRH's compression noise covariance and beamforming vectors, as\nwell as the routing strategy over the fronthaul network are jointly optimized\nbased on the successive convex approximation technique.

Our proposed LRCs could be of interest as they\nimprove UC without sacrificing optimality of the code.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jun 2016 12:41:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 1 Jul 2016 00:48:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 14 Jul 2016 22:43:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-18", "authors_parsed": [["Mehrabi", "Mehrtash", ""], ["Shahabinejad", "Mostafa", ""], ["Ardakani", "Masoud", ""], ["Khabbazian", "Majid", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.09494", "submitter": "Claudio Qureshi", "authors": "Claudio M.

Among the large panel of available measures, a special\nattention has been paid to convex $\\varphi$-divergences, such as\nKullback-Leibler, Jeffreys-Kullback, Hellinger, Chi-Square, Renyi, and\nI$_{\\alpha}$ divergences. While $\\varphi$-divergences have been extensively\nstudied in convex analysis, their use in optimization problems often remains\nchallenging. In this regard, one of the main shortcomings of existing methods\nis that the minimization of $\\varphi$-divergences is usually performed with\nrespect to one of their arguments, possibly within alternating optimization\ntechniques. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by deriving new\nclosed-form expressions for the proximity operator of such two-variable\nfunctions. This makes it possible to employ standard proximal methods for\nefficiently solving a wide range of convex optimization problems involving\n$\\varphi$-divergences. In addition, we show that these proximity operators are\nuseful to compute the epigraphical projection of several functions of practical\ninterest. The proposed proximal tools are numerically validated in the context\nof optimal query execution within database management systems, where the\nproblem of selectivity estimation plays a central role.
