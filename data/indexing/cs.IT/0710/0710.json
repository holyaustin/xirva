In the nomadic regime, we assume that the agents do not\nhave any decoding ability. These agents process their channel observations and\nforward them to the final destination through lossless links with a fixed\ncapacity. We propose new achievable rates based on elementary compression and\nalso on a Wyner-Ziv (CEO-like) processing, for both fast fading and block\nfading channels, as well as for general discrete channels. The simpler two\nagents scheme is solved, up to an implicit equation with a single variable.\nLimiting the nomadic transmitter to a circular-symmetric complex Gaussian\nsignalling, new upper bounds are derived for both fast and block fading, based\non the vector version of the entropy power inequality. These bounds are then\ncompared to the achievable rates in several extreme scenarios. The asymptotic\nsetting with numbers of agents and transmitter's antennas taken to infinity is\nanalyzed. In addition, the upper bounds are analytically shown to be tight in\nseveral examples, while numerical calculations reveal a rather small gap in a\nfinite $2\\times2$ setting. The advantage of the Wyner-Ziv approach over\nelementary compression is shown where only the former can achieve the full\ndiversity-multiplexing tradeoff. We also consider the non-nomadic setting, with\nagents that can decode. Here we give an achievable rate, over fast fading\nchannel, which combines broadcast with dirty paper coding and the decentralized\nreception, which was introduced for the nomadic setting.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Sep 2007 08:22:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Sanderovich", "Amichai", "", "Shitz"], ["Shamai", "Shlomo", "", "Shitz"], ["Steinberg", "Yossef", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.0142", "submitter": "Marco Baldi", "authors": "Marco Baldi", "title": "LDPC codes in the McEliece cryptosystem: attacks and countermeasures", "comments": "NATO Advanced Research Workshop 2008: Enhancing Crypto-Primitives\n  with Techniques from Coding Theory", "journal-ref": "NATO Science for Peace and Security Series - D: Information and\n  Communication Security, vol. 23, pp. 160-174, IOS Press, 2009.

The original\nversion, based on Goppa codes, is able to guarantee a high level of security,\nand is faster than competing solutions, like RSA.

Low-Density\nParity-Check (LDPC) codes are state-of-art forward error correcting codes that\npermit to approach the Shannon limit while ensuring limited complexity.\nQuasi-Cyclic (QC) LDPC codes are a particular class of LDPC codes, able to join\nlow complexity encoding of QC codes with high-performing and low-complexity\ndecoding of LDPC codes. In a previous work it has been proposed to adopt a\nparticular family of QC-LDPC codes in the McEliece cryptosystem to reduce the\nkey size and increase the transmission rate. Recently, however, new attacks\nhave been found that are able to exploit a flaw in the transformation from the\nprivate key to the public one. Such attacks can be effectively countered by\nchanging the form of some constituent matrices, without altering the system\nparameters. This work gives an overview of the QC-LDPC codes-based McEliece\ncryptosystem and its cryptanalysis. Two recent versions are considered, and\ntheir ability to counter all the currently known attacks is discussed. A third\nversion able to reach a higher security level is also proposed.

The goal of the present paper is to understand the\ndependence of this interesting result on the principal new features it\nintroduced relative to Gupta-Kumar: (1) a capacity-based formula for link\ntransmission bit-rates in terms of received signal-to-interference-and-noise\nratio (SINR); (2) hierarchical routing from sources to destinations through a\nsystem of communal highways; and (3) cell-based routes constructed by\npercolation. The conclusion of the present paper is that the improved\nthroughput scaling is principally due to the percolation-based routing, which\nenables shorter hops and, consequently, less interference. This is established\nby showing that throughput $\\Omega({1 \\over \\sqrt{n}})$ can be attained by a\nsystem that does not employ highways, but instead uses percolation to\nestablish, for each source-destination pair, a set of $\\Theta(\\log n)$ routes\nwithin a narrow routing corridor running from source to destination.

First, we consider the averaging attack where a random\ncoding argument is used to show that the rate 1/2 is achievable with t=2\npirates. Our study is then extended to the general case of arbitrary $t$\nhighlighting the underlying complexity-performance tradeoff.

Their decoding algorithm is an instance of (loopy) belief\npropagation and is based on an iterative transfer of constituent beliefs. The\nbeliefs are thereby given by the symbol probabilities computed in the\nconstituent trellises.
