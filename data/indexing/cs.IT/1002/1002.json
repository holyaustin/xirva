First, a minimum\ninterference-plus-noise leakage algorithm is presented, and shown to be\nequivalent to previous subspace methods when noise is spatially white or\nnegligible. A joint minimum mean squared error design is then proposed that\njointly optimizes the transmit precoders and receive spatial filters, whereas\nprevious designs neglect the receive spatial filter. This algorithm is shown to\nbe a generalization of previous joint MMSE designs for other system\nconfigurations such as the broadcast channel. Finally, a maximum\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio algorithm is developed that is proven\nto converge, unlike previous maximum SINR algorithms. The latter two designs\nare shown to have increased complexity due to non-orthogonal precoders, more\nrequired iterations, or more channel state knowledge than the min INL or\nsubspace methods. The sum throughput performance of these algorithms is\nsimulated in the context of a network with uncoordinated co-channel interferers\nnot participating in the alignment protocol.

Specially, these include (i) identical packets must be delivered\nsuccessfully to several nodes, (ii) outage at any receiver requires the packet\nto be retransmitted at least to that receiver, and (iii) the multicast rate is\ndominated by the receiver with the weakest link in order to minimize outage and\nretransmission. A first contribution of this paper is the development of a\ntractable multicast model and throughput metric that captures each of these key\ntraits in a multicast wireless network. We utilize a Poisson cluster process\n(PCP) consisting of a distinct Poisson point process (PPP) for the transmitters\nand receivers, and then define the multicast transmission capacity (MTC) as the\nmaximum achievable multicast rate per transmission attempt times the maximum\nintensity of multicast clusters under decoding delay and multicast outage\nconstraints. A multicast cluster is a contiguous area over which a packet is\nmulticasted, and to reduce outage it can be tessellated into $v$ smaller\nregions of multicast. The second contribution of the paper is the analysis of\nseveral key aspects of this model, for which we develop the following main\nresult. Assuming $\\tau/v$ transmission attempts are allowed for each\ntessellated region in a multicast cluster, we show that the MTC is $\\Theta(\\rho\nk^{x}\\log(k)v^{y})$ where $\\rho$, $x$ and $y$ are functions of $\\tau$ and $v$\ndepending on the network size and intensity, and $k$ is the average number of\nthe intended receivers in a cluster. We derive $\\{\\rho, x, y\\}$ for a number of\nregimes of interest, and also show that an appropriate number of\nretransmissions can significantly enhance the MTC.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 12 Feb 2010 22:52:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 17 Feb 2010 19:44:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 21 Feb 2010 04:17:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 24 Oct 2010 15:21:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-26", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Chun-Hung", ""], ["Andrews", "Jeffrey G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.2677", "submitter": "Sushil Subramanian", "authors": "Sushil Subramanian", "title": "Compressed Sensing for Sparse Underwater Channel Estimation: Some\n  Practical Considerations", "comments": "10 pages, 6 figures, 17 references", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We examine the use of a structured thresholding algorithm for sparse\nunderwater channel estimation using compressed sensing.

We present two capacity results under\nspecific noise correlation coefficients, one being achieved by DF and the other\nbeing achieved by direct link transmission (or a special case of CF). The\nchannel for the former capacity result is equivalent to the traditional\nGaussian degraded relay channel and the latter corresponds to the Gaussian\nreversely-degraded relay channel. For CF and AF schemes, we show that their\nachievable rates are strictly decreasing functions over the negative\ncorrelation coefficient. Through numerical comparisons under different channel\nsettings, we observe that although DF completely disregards the noise\ncorrelation while the other two can potentially exploit such extra information,\nnone of the three relay schemes always outperforms the others over different\ncorrelation coefficients. Moreover, the exploitation of noise correlation by CF\nand AF accrues more benefit when the source-relay link is weak. This paper also\nconsiders the optimal power allocation problem under the correlated-noise\nchannel setting. With individual power constraints at the relay and the source,\nit is shown that the relay should use all its available power to maximize the\nachievable rates under any correlation coefficient.

Using large random matrix theory results, it can be shown\nthat traditional subspace estimates are not consistent in this asymptotic\nregime. Furthermore, new consistent subspace estimate can be proposed, which\noutperform the standard subspace methods for realistic values of $M$ and $N$.\nThe work carried out so far in this area has always been based on the\nassumption that the observations are random, independent and identically\ndistributed in the time domain. The goal of this paper is to propose new\nconsistent subspace estimators for the case where the source signals are\nmodelled as unknown deterministic signals. In practice, this allows to use the\nproposed approach regardless of the statistical properties of the source\nsignals. In order to construct the proposed estimators, new technical results\nconcerning the almost sure location of the eigenvalues of sample covariance\nmatrices of Information plus Noise complex Gaussian models are established.\nThese results are believed to be of independent interest.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Feb 2010 10:00:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 29 Sep 2011 07:46:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Vallet", "Pascal", ""], ["Loubaton", "Philippe", ""], ["Mestre", "Xavier", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.3239", "submitter": "Nicholas Ruozzi", "authors": "Nicholas Ruozzi, Sekhar Tatikonda", "title": "Message-Passing Algorithms: Reparameterizations and Splittings", "comments": "A complete rework and expansion of the previous versions", "journal-ref": "Information Theory, IEEE Transactions on , vol.59, no.9,\n  pp.5860,5881, Sept. 2013", "doi": "10.1109/TIT.2013.2259576", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.AI math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The max-product algorithm, a local message-passing scheme that attempts to\ncompute the most probable assignment (MAP) of a given probability distribution,\nhas been successfully employed as a method of approximate inference for\napplications arising in coding theory, computer vision, and machine learning.\nHowever, the max-product algorithm is not guaranteed to converge to the MAP\nassignment, and if it does, is not guaranteed to recover the MAP assignment.\n  Alternative convergent message-passing schemes have been proposed to overcome\nthese difficulties.

The\nscheduler indirectly estimates the channel via accumulated delayed-ARQ feedback\nand uses this information to make scheduling decisions.

This paper then presented a lower bound to the\nminimum WSDT that is easily computed and turns out to be tight across a wide\nrange of parameterizations of the problem.
