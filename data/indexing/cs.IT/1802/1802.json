In\nthis work, in addition to revisiting the entropy minimization conjecture, we\nalso address several related combinatorial problems. We present an algorithm\nfor counting the number of subsequence embeddings using a run-length encoding\nof strings. We then describe methods for clustering the space of supersequences\nsuch that the cardinality of the resulting sets depends only on the length of\nthe received subsequence and its Hamming weight, but not its exact form. Then,\nwe consider supersequences that contain a single embedding of a fixed\nsubsequence, referred to as singletons, and provide a closed form expression\nfor enumerating them using the same run-length encoding. We prove an analogous\nresult for the minimization and maximization of the number of singletons, by\nthe alternating and the uniform strings, respectively. Next, we prove the\noriginal minimal entropy conjecture for the special cases of single and double\ndeletions using similar clustering techniques and the same run-length encoding,\nwhich allow us to characterize the distribution of the number of subsequence\nembeddings in the space of compatible supersequences to demonstrate the effect\nof an entropy decreasing operation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Feb 2018 14:37:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 4 Mar 2019 17:53:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Atashpendar", "Arash", ""], ["Beunardeau", "Marc", ""], ["Connolly", "Aisling", ""], ["G\u00e9raud", "R\u00e9mi", ""], ["Mestel", "David", ""], ["Roscoe", "A.

Under a generative hypergraph\nmodel called \"d-wise hypergraph stochastic block model\" (d-hSBM) which\nnaturally extends the Stochastic Block Model from graphs to d-uniform\nhypergraphs, the asymptotic minimax mismatch ratio is characterized. For\nproving the achievability, we propose a two-step polynomial time algorithm that\nachieves the fundamental limit. The first step of the algorithm is a hypergraph\nspectral clustering method which achieves partial recovery to a certain\nprecision level. The second step is a local refinement method which leverages\nthe underlying probabilistic model along with parameter estimation from the\noutcome of the first step. To characterize the asymptotic performance of the\nproposed algorithm, we first derive a sufficient condition for attaining weak\nconsistency in the hypergraph spectral clustering step. Then, under the\nguarantee of weak consistency in the first step, we upper bound the worst-case\nrisk attained in the local refinement step by an exponentially decaying\nfunction of the size of the hypergraph and characterize the decaying rate. For\nproving the converse, the lower bound of the minimax mismatch ratio is set by\nfinding a smaller parameter space which contains the most dominant error\nevents, inspired by the analysis in the achievability part. It turns out that\nthe minimax mismatch ratio decays exponentially fast to zero as the number of\nnodes tends to infinity, and the rate function is a weighted combination of\nseveral divergence terms, each of which is the Renyi divergence of order 1/2\nbetween two Bernoulli's.

Cloud radio access network (CRAN), in which low-complexity remote\nradio heads (RRHs) coordinated by a central unit (CU) are deployed to serve\nusers in a distributed manner, is a cost-effective solution to achieve network\ndensification. However, when operating over a large bandwidth in the mmWave\nfrequencies, the digital fronthaul links in a CRAN would be easily saturated by\nthe large amount of sampled and quantized signals to be transferred between\nRRHs and the CU. To tackle this challenge, we propose in this paper a new\narchitecture for mmWave-based CRAN with advanced lens antenna arrays at the\nRRHs. Due to the energy focusing property, lens antenna arrays are effective in\nexploiting the angular sparsity of mmWave channels, and thus help in\nsubstantially reducing the fronthaul rate and simplifying the signal processing\nat the multi-antenna RRHs and the CU, even when the channels are\nfrequency-selective.

In asymptotic\nterms, this reveals that as long as $L$ scales with the theoretical caching\ngain, then the full cumulative (multiplexing + full caching) gains are achieved\nwith constant subpacketization.

This article will provide a systematic overview of the\nstate-of-the-art design of the NoMA transmission based on a unified transceiver\ndesign framework, the related standardization progress, and some promising use\ncases in future cellular networks, based on which the interested researchers\ncan get a quick start in this area.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 12 Feb 2018 04:07:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-13", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Yan", ""], ["Bayesteh", "Alireza", ""], ["Wu", "Yiqun", ""], ["Ren", "Bin", ""], ["Kang", "Shaoli", ""], ["Sun", "Shaohui", ""], ["Xiong", "Qi", ""], ["Qian", "Chen", ""], ["Yu", "Bin", ""], ["Ding", "Zhiguo", ""], ["Wang", "Sen", ""], ["Han", "Shuangfeng", ""], ["Hou", "Xiaolin", ""], ["Lin", "Hao", ""], ["Visoz", "Raphael", ""], ["Razavi", "Razieh", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.03889", "submitter": "Xiao Li", "authors": "Zhihui Zhu and Xiao Li", "title": "Convergence Analysis of Alternating Projection Method for Nonconvex Sets", "comments": "21 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Alternating projection method has been used in a wide range of engineering\napplications since it is a gradient-free method (without requiring tuning the\nstep size) and usually has fast speed of convergence.

A tight upper-bound for SER\nwith low-resolution DAC precoding is first derived.

Past work in this area was\nlimited by strong assumptions which are addressed by the novel approach here.\nSpecifically, in this paper we (1) incorporate saturation in a point process\nmodel which both ensures stability and models non-linear thresholding effects;\n(2) impose general low-dimensional structural assumptions that include\nsparsity, group sparsity and low-rankness that allows bounds to be developed in\nthe high-dimensional setting; and (3) incorporate long-range memory effects\nthrough moving average and higher-order auto-regressive components. Using our\ngeneral framework, we provide a number of novel theoretical guarantees for\nhigh-dimensional self-exciting point processes that reflect the role played by\nthe underlying network structure and long-term memory. We also provide\nsimulations and real data examples to support our methodology and main results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Feb 2018 20:06:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-15", "authors_parsed": [["Mark", "Benjamin", ""], ["Raskutti", "Garvesh", ""], ["Willett", "Rebecca", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.04923", "submitter": "Kang Gao", "authors": "Kang Gao, J.

To\nenable multi-user transmissions, the base-station uses a cell-specific codebook\nof beamforming vectors over an initial beam alignment phase. Each user uses a\nuser-specific codebook of beamforming vectors to learn the top-P (where P >= 1)\nbeam pairs in terms of the observed SNR in a single-user setting. The top-P\nbeam indices along with their SNRs are fed back from each user and the\nbase-station leverages this information to generate beam weights for\nsimultaneous transmissions. A typical method to generate the beam weights is to\nuse only the best beam for each user and either steer energy along this beam,\nor to utilize this information to reduce multi-user interference. The other\nbeams are used as fall back options to address blockage or mobility. Such an\napproach completely discards information learned about the channel condition(s)\neven though each user feeds back this information. With this background, this\nwork develops an advanced directional precoding structure for simultaneous\ntransmissions at the cost of an additional marginal feedback overhead. This\nconstruction relies on three main innovations: 1) Additional feedback to allow\nthe base-station to reconstruct a rank-P approximation of the channel matrix\nbetween it and each user, 2) A zeroforcing structure that leverages this\ninformation to combat multi-user interference by remaining agnostic of the\nreceiver beam knowledge in the precoder design, and 3) A hybrid precoding\narchitecture that allows both amplitude and phase control at low-complexity and\ncost to allow the implementation of the zeroforcing structure.

The increasing maturity\nof millimeter wave (mm-wave) communication has opened up the possibility of\nproviding high-speed wireless backhaul to such cell sites. Since mm-wave is\nalso suitable for access links, the third generation partnership project (3GPP)\nis envisioning an integrated access and backhaul (IAB) architecture for the\nfifth generation (5G) cellular networks in which the same infrastructure and\nspectral resources will be used for both access and backhaul. In this paper, we\ndevelop an analytical framework for IAB-enabled cellular network using which\nits downlink rate coverage probability is accurately characterized. Using this\nframework, we study the performance of three backhaul bandwidth (BW) partition\nstrategies: 1) equal partition: when all SBSs obtain equal share of the\nbackhaul BW; 2) instantaneous load-based partition: when the backhaul BW share\nof an SBS is proportional to its instantaneous load; and 3) average load-based\npartition: when the backhaul BW share of an SBS is proportional to its average\nload. Our analysis shows that depending on the choice of the partition\nstrategy, there exists an optimal split of access and backhaul BW for which the\nrate coverage is maximized. Further, there exists a critical volume of\ncell-load (total number of users) beyond which the gains provided by the\nIAB-enabled network disappear and its performance converges to that of the\ntraditional macro-only network with no SBSs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 24 Feb 2018 01:03:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 11 Nov 2018 00:38:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Saha", "Chiranjib", ""], ["Afshang", "Mehrnaz", ""], ["Dhillon", "Harpreet S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.08855", "submitter": "Shashank Singh", "authors": "Shashank Singh, Barnab\\'as P\\'oczos", "title": "Minimax Distribution Estimation in Wasserstein Distance", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST cs.IT cs.LG math.IT stat.ML stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Wasserstein metric is an important measure of distance between\nprobability distributions, with applications in machine learning, statistics,\nprobability theory, and data analysis.

Second, the invariance of the IB functional under bijections prevents\nit from capturing properties of the learned representation that are desirable\nfor classification, such as robustness and simplicity.

These resources can be scavenged by\noffloading heavy computation tasks from small IoT devices in proximity, thereby\novercoming their limitations and lengthening their battery lives. However,\nunlike dedicated servers, the spare resources offered by edge helpers are\nrandom and intermittent. Thus, it is essential for a user to intelligently\ncontrol the amounts of data for offloading and local computing so as to ensure\na computation task can be finished in time consuming minimum energy. In this\npaper, we design energy-efficient control policies in a computation offloading\nsystem with a random channel and a helper with a dynamically loaded CPU.\nSpecifically, the policy adopted by the helper aims at determining the sizes of\noffloaded and locally-computed data for a given task in different slots such\nthat the total energy consumption for transmission and local CPU is minimized\nunder a task-deadline constraint. As the result, the polices endow an\noffloading user robustness against channel-and-helper randomness besides\nbalancing offloading and local computing. By modeling the channel and\nhelper-CPU as Markov chains, the problem of offloading control is converted\ninto a Markov-decision process. Though dynamic programming (DP) for numerically\nsolving the problem does not yield the optimal policies in closed form, we\nleverage the procedure to quantify the optimal policy structure and apply the\nresult to design optimal or sub-optimal policies.

In this Part II of the paper,\nwe study discrete problems, such as those involving user scheduling, which are\nconsiderably more difficult to solve. Unlike the continuous problems, discrete\nor mixed discrete-continuous problems normally cannot be recast as convex\nproblems. In contrast to the common heuristic of relaxing the discrete\nvariables, this work reformulates the original problem in an FP form amenable\nto distributed combinatorial optimization. The paper illustrates this\nmethodology by tackling the important and challenging problem of uplink\ncoordinated multi-cell user scheduling in wireless cellular systems. Uplink\nscheduling is more challenging than downlink scheduling, because uplink user\nscheduling decisions significantly affect the interference pattern in nearby\ncells. Further, the discrete scheduling variable needs to be optimized jointly\nwith continuous variables such as transmit power levels and beamformers. The\nmain idea of the proposed FP approach is to decouple the interaction among the\ninterfering links, thereby permitting a distributed and joint optimization of\nthe discrete and continuous variables with provable convergence. The paper\nshows that the well-known weighted minimum mean-square-error (WMMSE) algorithm\ncan also be derived from a particular use of FP; but our proposed FP-based\nmethod significantly outperforms WMMSE when discrete user scheduling variables\nare involved, both in term of run-time efficiency and optimizing results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Feb 2018 22:41:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 1 Mar 2018 20:18:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-09", "authors_parsed": [["Shen", "Kaiming", ""], ["Yu", "Wei", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.10259", "submitter": "Hessam Pirzadeh", "authors": "Hessam Pirzadeh, A.

While the number of radio\nfrequency (RF) chains has been effectively reduced in existing works, a large\nnumber of high-precision phase shifters are still needed. Practical phase\nshifters are with coarsely quantized phases, and their number should be reduced\nto a minimum due to cost and power consideration. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel hardware-efficient implementation for hybrid precoding, called the fixed\nphase shifter (FPS) implementation. It only requires a small number of phase\nshifters with quantized and fixed phases. To enhance the spectral efficiency, a\nswitch network is put forward to provide dynamic connections from phase\nshifters to antennas, which is adaptive to the channel states. An effective\nalternating minimization (AltMin) algorithm is developed with closed-form\nsolutions in each iteration to determine the hybrid precoder and the states of\nswitches. Moreover, to further reduce the hardware complexity, a\ngroup-connected mapping strategy is proposed to reduce the number of switches.\nSimulation results show that the FPS fully-connected hybrid precoder achieves\nhigher hardware efficiency with much fewer phase shifters than existing\nproposals. Furthermore, the group-connected mapping achieves a good balance\nbetween spectral efficiency and hardware complexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Feb 2018 09:24:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Yu", "Xianghao", ""], ["Zhang", "Jun", ""], ["Letaief", "Khaled B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.10329", "submitter": "Oliver De Candido", "authors": "Oliver De Candido, Hela Jedda, Amine Mezghani, A.

This general result is\nthen specialized to 3GPP-inspired user and BS configurations obtained by\ncombining Poisson point process (PPP) and Poisson cluster process (PCP).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Feb 2018 17:42:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Afshang", "Mehrnaz", ""], ["Saha", "Chiranjib", ""], ["Dhillon", "Harpreet S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.10575", "submitter": "Ilias Diakonikolas", "authors": "Timothy Carpenter, Ilias Diakonikolas, Anastasios Sidiropoulos,\n  Alistair Stewart", "title": "Near-Optimal Sample Complexity Bounds for Maximum Likelihood Estimation\n  of Multivariate Log-concave Densities", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "COLT 2018 proceedings version", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST cs.IT cs.LG math.IT stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the problem of learning multivariate log-concave densities with\nrespect to a global loss function. We obtain the first upper bound on the\nsample complexity of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for a log-concave\ndensity on $\\mathbb{R}^d$, for all $d \\geq 4$. Prior to this work, no finite\nsample upper bound was known for this estimator in more than $3$ dimensions.\n  In more detail, we prove that for any $d \\geq 1$ and $\\epsilon>0$, given\n$\\tilde{O}_d((1/\\epsilon)^{(d+3)/2})$ samples drawn from an unknown log-concave\ndensity $f_0$ on $\\mathbb{R}^d$, the MLE outputs a hypothesis $h$ that with\nhigh probability is $\\epsilon$-close to $f_0$, in squared Hellinger loss. A\nsample complexity lower bound of $\\Omega_d((1/\\epsilon)^{(d+1)/2})$ was\npreviously known for any learning algorithm that achieves this guarantee. We\nthus establish that the sample complexity of the log-concave MLE is\nnear-optimal, up to an $\\tilde{O}(1/\\epsilon)$ factor.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Feb 2018 18:32:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 Dec 2018 00:07:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-06", "authors_parsed": [["Carpenter", "Timothy", ""], ["Diakonikolas", "Ilias", ""], ["Sidiropoulos", "Anastasios", ""], ["Stewart", "Alistair", ""]]}]
