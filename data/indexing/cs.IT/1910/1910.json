Our contributions are two-fold: We\nfirst propose an efficient method to minimize the transition waste, a newly\nintroduced concept quantifying the total number of tasks that existing machines\nhave to abandon or take on anew when a machine joins or leaves, for the cyclic\nelastic task allocation scheme recently proposed in the literature (Yang et al.\nISIT'19). We then proceed to generalize such a scheme and introduce new task\nallocation schemes based on finite geometry that achieve zero transition wastes\nas long as the number of active machines varies within a fixed range. The\nproposed solutions can be applied on top of every existing coded computing\nscheme tolerating stragglers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Oct 2019 06:44:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Dau", "Hoang", ""], ["Gabrys", "Ryan", ""], ["Huang", "Yu-Chih", ""], ["Feng", "Chen", ""], ["Luu", "Quang-Hung", ""], ["Alzahrani", "Eidah", ""], ["Tari", "Zahir", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.00853", "submitter": "Pablo Martinez Olmos", "authors": "Javier C\\'epedes, Pablo M.

Numerical results show that our proposed\nalgorithms achieve substantially increased capacity compared to traditional\nMIMO channels without the IRS, and also outperform various benchmark schemes.\nIn particular, it is shown that with the proposed algorithms, various key\nparameters of the IRS-aided MIMO channel such as channel total power, rank, and\ncondition number can be significantly improved for capacity enhancement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Oct 2019 16:20:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Shuowen", ""], ["Zhang", "Rui", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.01625", "submitter": "Leighton Barnes", "authors": "Leighton Pate Barnes and Ayfer Ozgur", "title": "Minimax Bounds for Distributed Logistic Regression", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a distributed logistic regression problem where labeled data\npairs $(X_i,Y_i)\\in \\mathbb{R}^d\\times\\{-1,1\\}$ for $i=1,\\ldots,n$ are\ndistributed across multiple machines in a network and must be communicated to a\ncentralized estimator using at most $k$ bits per labeled pair.

A key feature of this\nscheduling algorithm is that it takes into account the informativeness of data\nsamples, besides communication reliability.

We first derive an explicit\nexpression for this indicator targeting the classic classifier of support\nvector machine (SVM), where the uncertainty of a data sample is measured by its\ndistance to the decision boundary. Then, the result is extended to\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN) by replacing the distance based uncertainty\nmeasure with the entropy. As demonstrated via experiments using real datasets,\nthe proposed importance-aware scheduling can exploit the two-fold multi-user\ndiversity, namely the diversity in both the multiuser channels and the\ndistributed data samples.

The hinge vector is\nalso efficiently compressed using another low-dimensional Grassmannian\nquantizer. The other feature of the framework is a bit-allocation scheme for\nreducing the quantization error. The scheme determines the resolutions of the\nlow-dimensional quantizers in the proposed framework. The framework is proved\nto guarantee model convergency by analyzing the convergence rate as a function\nof the quantization bits.

A\ndifference-of-convex (DC) algorithm is further developed to solve the resulting\nDC programs via successive convex relaxation, followed by establishing the\nconvergence of the proposed DC-based alternating optimization method. We\nfurther propose an efficient user ordering scheme with closed-form expressions,\nconsidering both the channel conditions and users' target data rates.\nSimulation results will validate the effectiveness of deploying an RIS and the\nsuperiority of the proposed DC-based alternating optimization method in\nreducing the total transmit power.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Oct 2019 14:13:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 1 Nov 2019 12:35:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 22 Mar 2020 07:50:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Fu", "Min", ""], ["Zhou", "Yong", ""], ["Shi", "Yuanming", ""], ["Letaief", "Khaled B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.07420", "submitter": "Pulakesh Upadhyaya", "authors": "Pulakesh Upadhyaya, Anxiao Jiang", "title": "Machine Learning for Error Correction with Natural Redundancy", "comments": "35 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1811.04032", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The persistent storage of big data requires advanced error correction\nschemes.

Consequently, it is important to\nunderstand codes that implement such gates transversally. In this paper, we\nadopt an algebraic approach to characterize all stabilizer codes for which\ntransversal $T$ and $T^{-1}$ gates preserve the codespace. Our Heisenberg\nperspective reduces this to a finite geometry problem that translates to the\ndesign of certain classical codes. We prove three corollaries: (a) For any\nnon-degenerate $[[ n,k,d ]]$ stabilizer code supporting a physical transversal\n$T$, there exists an $[[ n,k,d ]]$ CSS code with the same property; (b)\nTriorthogonal codes are the most general CSS codes that realize logical\ntransversal $T$ via physical transversal $T$; (c) Triorthogonality is necessary\nfor physical transversal $T$ on a CSS code to realize the logical identity. The\nmain tool we use is a recent efficient characterization of certain diagonal\ngates in the Clifford hierarchy (arXiv:1902.04022). We refer to these gates as\nQuadratic Form Diagonal (QFD) gates. Our framework generalizes all existing\ncode constructions that realize logical gates via transversal $T$.

In particular, using Ax's theorem on\nresidue weights of polynomials, we provide an alternate characterization of\nlogical gates induced by transversal $\\pi/2^{\\ell}$ $Z$-rotations on a family\nof quantum Reed-Muller codes.

AC-RLNC is adaptive to the estimated\nchannel condition, and is causal, as the coding adjusts the retransmission\nrates using a priori and posteriori algorithms. In the multipath network, to\nachieve the desired throughput and delay, we propose to incorporate an adaptive\npacket allocation algorithm for retransmission, across the available resources\nof the paths. This approach is based on a discrete water filling algorithm,\ni.e., bit-filling, but, with two desired objectives, maximize throughput and\nminimize the delay. In the multipath multi-hop setting, we propose a new\ndecentralized balancing optimization algorithm. This balancing algorithm\nminimizes the throughput degradation, caused by the variations in the channel\nquality of the paths at each hop.

The Angular Spread\nFunction (ASF) of the corresponding M-dim channel vector describes the angular\ndensity of the received signal power at the array. The modern literature on\nmassive MIMO has recognized that the knowledge of covariance matrix of user\nchannel vectors is very useful for various applications such as hybrid digital\nanalog beamforming, pilot decontamination, etc. Therefore, most literature has\nfocused on the estimation of such channel covariance matrices. However, in some\napplications such as uplink-downlink covariance transformation (for FDD massive\nMIMO precoding) and channel sounding some form of ASF estimation is required\neither implicitly or explicitly. It turns out that while covariance estimation\nis well-known and well-conditioned, the ASF estimation is a much harder problem\nand is in general ill-posed. In this paper, we show that under additional\ngeometrically-consistent group-sparsity structure on the ASF, which is\nprevalent in almost all wireless propagation scenarios, one is able to estimate\nASF properly. We propose sparse dictionary-based algorithms that promote this\ngroup-sparsity structure via suitable regularizations.
