In contrast with many existing works on energy-efficient power control,\nwhich ignore the possible presence of a queue at the transmitter, we consider a\nnew generalized cross-layer EE metric. This approach is relevant when the\ntransmitters have a non-zero energy cost even when the radiated power is zero\nand takes into account the presence of a finite packet buffer and packet\narrival at the transmitter. As the Nash equilibrium (NE) is an\nenergy-inefficient solution, the present work aims at overcoming this deficit\nby improving the global energy-efficiency. Indeed, as the considered system has\nmultiple agencies each with their own interest, the performance metric\nreflecting the individual interest of each decision maker is the global\nenergy-efficiency defined then as the sum over individual energy-efficiencies.\nRepeated games (RG) are investigated through the study of two dynamic games\n(finite RG and discounted RG), whose equilibrium is defined when introducing a\nnew operating point (OP), Pareto-dominating the NE and relying only on\nindividual channel state information (CSI). Accordingly, closed-form\nexpressions of the minimum number of stages of the game for finite RG (FRG) and\nthe maximum discount factor of the discounted RG (DRG) were established. The\ncross-layer model in the RG formulation leads to achieving a shorter minimum\nnumber of stages in the FRG even for higher number of users. In addition, the\nsocial welfare (sum of utilities) in the DRG decreases slightly with the\ncross-layer model when the number of users increases while it is reduced\nconsiderably with the Goodman model.

In the data-sharing strategy, the backhaul links connecting the\ncentral processor (CP) and the base-stations (BSs) are used to carry user\nmessages -- each user's messages are sent to multiple BSs; the BSs locally form\nthe beamforming vectors then cooperatively transmit the messages to the user.\nIn the compression strategy, the user messages are precoded centrally at the\nCP, which forwards a compressed version of the analog beamformed signals to the\nBSs for cooperative transmission. This paper compares the energy efficiencies\nof the two strategies by formulating an optimization problem of minimizing the\ntotal network power consumption subject to user target rate constraints, where\nthe total network power includes the BS transmission power, BS activation\npower, and load-dependent backhaul power. To tackle the discrete and nonconvex\nnature of the optimization problems, we utilize the techniques of reweighted\n$\\ell_1$ minimization and successive convex approximation to devise provably\nconvergent algorithms.

Two\nfronthauling modes are considered, namely a hard-transfer mode, whereby\nnon-cached files are communicated over the fronthaul links to a subset of\neRRHs, and a soft-transfer mode, whereby the fronthaul links are used to convey\nquantized baseband signals as in a C-RAN.

Towards this goal, we first note the structure of\nthe optimal beamformer with per-antenna gain and phase control and the\nstructure of good beamformers with per-antenna phase-only control. Learning\nthese beamforming structures in mmW systems is fraught with considerable\ncomplexities such as the need for a non-broadcast system design, the\nsensitivity of the beamformer approximants to small path length changes, etc.\nTo overcome these issues, we establish a physical interpretation between these\nbeamformer structures and the angles of departure/arrival of the dominant\npath(s). This physical interpretation provides a theoretical underpinning to\nthe emerging interest on directional beamforming approaches that are less\nsensitive to small path length changes. While classical approaches for\ndirection learning such as MUSIC have been well-understood, they suffer from\nmany practical difficulties in a mmW context such as a non-broadcast system\ndesign and high computational complexity. A simpler broadcast solution for mmW\nsystems is the adaptation of directional codebooks for beamforming at the two\nends.

Our single-shot analysis applies to all\ndiscrete random variables and yields upper and lower bound of a similar form.\nIn fact, the bounds are asymptotically tight and lead to a characterization of\nthe optimal rate of communication needed for data exchange for a general\nsequence such as mixture of IID random variables as well as the optimal\nsecond-order asymptotic term in the length of communication needed for data\nexchange for the IID random variables, when the probability of error is fixed.\nThis gives a precise characterization of the asymptotic reduction in the length\nof optimal communication due to interaction; in particular, two-sided\nSlepian-Wolf compression is strictly suboptimal.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 Jan 2016 15:16:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 30 Jan 2016 02:17:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 11 Nov 2017 07:20:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Tyagi", "Himanshu", ""], ["Viswanath", "Pramod", ""], ["Watanabe", "Shun", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.03660", "submitter": "Ziv Goldfeld", "authors": "Ziv Goldfeld, Paul Cuff and Haim H.

For any construction of secure\nlinear network codes (SLNCs) over a wiretap network, the based field size is a\nvery important index, because it largely determines the computational and space\ncomplexities, and further the efficiency of network transmission. Further, it\nis also very important for the process of secure network coding from\ntheoretical research to practical applications.

First, decreasing inter-wire\nspacing increases interline capacitive coupling, which adversely affects\ntransmission energy and delay. Second, lower voltage swings render the\ntransmission susceptible to various noise sources. Coding can be used to\naddress both these problems. So-called crosstalk-avoidance codes mitigate\ncapacitive coupling, and traditional error-correction codes introduce\nresilience against channel errors.\n  Unfortunately, crosstalk-avoidance and error-correction codes cannot be\ncombined in a straightforward manner. On the one hand, crosstalk-avoidance\nencoding followed by error-correction encoding destroys the crosstalk-avoidance\nproperty. On the other hand, error-correction encoding followed by\ncrosstalk-avoidance encoding causes the crosstalk-avoidance decoder to fail in\nthe presence of errors. Existing approaches circumvent this difficulty by using\nadditional bus wires to protect the parities generated from the output of the\nerror-correction encoder, and are therefore inefficient.\n  In this work we propose a novel joint crosstalk-avoidance and\nerror-correction coding and decoding scheme that provides higher bus\ntransmission rates compared to existing approaches. Our joint approach\ncarefully embeds the parities such that the crosstalk-avoidance property is\npreserved. We analyze the rate and minimum distance of the proposed scheme.

In a few auspicious\ncases, such as the classical capacity of a classical channel, the capacity\nregion of a multiple access channel and the entanglement assisted capacity of a\nquantum channel, additivity allows a full characterization of optimal rates.\nHere we present a new mathematical property of entropic formulas, uniform\nadditivity, that is both easily evaluated and rich enough to capture all known\nquantum additive formulas. We give a complete characterization of uniformly\nadditive functions using the linear programming approach to entropy\ninequalities. In addition to all known quantum formulas, we find a new and\nintriguing additive quantity: the completely coherent information. We also\nuncover a remarkable coincidence---the classical and quantum uniformly additive\nfunctions are identical; the tractable answers in classical and quantum\ninformation theory are formally equivalent. Our techniques pave the way for a\ndeeper understanding of the tractability of information theory, from classical\nmulti-user problems like broadcast channels to the evaluation of quantum\nchannel capacities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Jan 2016 21:10:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["Cross", "Andrew W.", ""], ["Li", "Ke", ""], ["Smith", "Graeme", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.05516", "submitter": "Linqi Song", "authors": "Linqi Song, and Christina Fragouli", "title": "A Deterministic Algorithm for Pliable Index Coding", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Pliable index coding considers a server with m messages, and n clients where\neach has as side information a subset of the messages.

We show\nthat the construction based on rank-metric codes by Silberstein et al. can be\nadapted to obtain codes with unequal all symbol locality that achieve the\nminimum distance bound. Finally, we introduce the concept of \"locality\nrequirement\" on a code, which can be viewed as a recoverability requirement on\nsymbols. Information locality requirement on a code essentially specifies the\nminimum number of information symbols of different localities that must be\npresent in the code. We present a greedy algorithm that assigns localities to\ninformation symbols so as to maximize the minimum distance among all codes that\nsatisfy a given locality requirement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Jan 2016 20:57:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-25", "authors_parsed": [["Kadhe", "Swanand", ""], ["Sprintson", "Alex", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.06176", "submitter": "Christoph Adami", "authors": "Christoph Adami", "title": "What is Information?", "comments": "19 pages, 2 figures.

A change point is the time instant at which the\ndistribution of a random process changes. The objective of quickest change\ndetection is to minimize the detection delay of an unknown change point under\ncertain performance constraints, such as average run length (ARL) to false\nalarm or probability of false alarm (PFA). Most existing change detection\nprocedures assume perfect knowledge of the random process distributions before\nand after the change point.

The impacts of\nmismatched models are characterized in terms of various finite or asymptotic\nperformance bounds on ARL, PFA, and average detection delay (ADD).

There are many different\ntechnologies that generate the reads: widely-used second-generation methods\ncreate short reads with low error rates, while emerging third-generation\nmethods create long reads with high error rates. Both error rates and error\nprofiles differ among methods, so reconstruction algorithms are often tailored\nto specific shotgun sequencing technologies. As these methods change over time,\na fundamental question is whether there exist reconstruction algorithms which\nare robust, i.e., which perform well under a wide range of error distributions.\n  Here we study this question of sequence assembly from corrupted reads. We\nmake no assumption on the types of errors in the reads, but only assume a bound\non their magnitude. More precisely, for each read we assume that instead of\nreceiving the true read with no errors, we receive a corrupted read which has\nedit distance at most $\\epsilon$ times the length of the read from the true\nread. We show that if the reads are long enough and there are sufficiently many\nof them, then approximate reconstruction is possible: we construct a simple\nalgorithm such that for almost all original sequences the output of the\nalgorithm is a sequence whose edit distance from the original one is at most\n$O(\\epsilon)$ times the length of the original sequence.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Jan 2016 16:29:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-28", "authors_parsed": [["Ganguly", "Shirshendu", ""], ["Mossel", "Elchanan", ""], ["Racz", "Miklos Z.", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.07087", "submitter": "Kyung Su Kim", "authors": "Kyung Su Kim, Sae-Young Chung", "title": "Greedy Subspace Pursuit for Joint Sparse Recovery", "comments": "55 pages, 8 figures, to be submitted to IEEE Transactions on\n  Information theory, a shorter version was submitted to Proc.

One of the consequences of this set of\ninequalities is that for $K\\geq3$, it is shown that the DoF region is not\ncompletely characterized by the marginal probabilities in contrast to the\ntwo-user case. Afterwards, the tightness of these bounds are investigated\nthrough the discussion on the achievability. Finally, a two user MIMO BC having\nCSIT among P and N is considered in which an outer bound for the DoF region is\nprovided and it is shown that in some scenarios it is tight.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Jan 2016 11:09:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-28", "authors_parsed": [["Rassouli", "Borzoo", ""], ["Hao", "Chenxi", ""], ["Clerckx", "Bruno", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.07340", "submitter": "Xianghao Yu", "authors": "Xianghao Yu, Juei-Chin Shen, Jun Zhang, and Khaled B.

In contrast to conventional\nmultiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems, precoding in mmWave MIMO cannot\nbe performed entirely at baseband using digital precoders, as only a limited\nnumber of signal mixers and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) can be\nsupported considering their cost and power consumption. As a cost-effective\nalternative, a hybrid precoding transceiver architecture, combining a digital\nprecoder and an analog precoder, has recently received considerable attention.\nHowever, the optimal design of such hybrid precoders has not been fully\nunderstood. In this paper, treating the hybrid precoder design as a matrix\nfactorization problem, effective alternating minimization (AltMin) algorithms\nwill be proposed for two different hybrid precoding structures, i.e., the\nfully-connected and partially-connected structures. In particular, for the\nfully-connected structure, an AltMin algorithm based on manifold optimization\nis proposed to approach the performance of the fully digital precoder, which,\nhowever, has a high complexity. Thus, a low-complexity AltMin algorithm is then\nproposed, by enforcing an orthogonal constraint on the digital precoder.\nFurthermore, for the partially-connected structure, an AltMin algorithm is also\ndeveloped with the help of semidefinite relaxation. For practical\nimplementation, the proposed AltMin algorithms are further extended to the\nbroadband setting with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)\nmodulation. Simulation results will demonstrate significant performance gains\nof the proposed AltMin algorithms over existing hybrid precoding algorithms.\nMoreover, based on the proposed algorithms, simulation comparisons between the\ntwo hybrid precoding structures will provide valuable design insights.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Jan 2016 12:15:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-04", "authors_parsed": [["Yu", "Xianghao", ""], ["Shen", "Juei-Chin", ""], ["Zhang", "Jun", ""], ["Letaief", "Khaled B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.07343", "submitter": "Masaaki Harada", "authors": "T.

We suggest to use a slightly more\ngeneral version of these codes (but which has the same decoding performances as\nthe $\\left( U\\mid U+V\\right)$-construction) for code-based cryptography, namely\nto build a McEliece scheme. The point is here that these codes not only perform\nnearly as well (or even better in the low rate regime) as Reed-Solomon codes,\ntheir structure seems to avoid the Sidelnikov-Shestakov attack which broke a\nprevious McEliece proposal based on generalized Reed-Solomon codes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jan 2016 19:30:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["M\u00e1rquez-Corbella", "Irene", ""], ["Tillich", "Jean-Pierre", ""]]}]
