If the most likely codeword is selected,\nsimulation results show that the resulting performance is very close to that of\na maximum-likelihood decoder, even for moderate values of $L$. Alternatively,\nif a \"genie\" is allowed to pick the codeword from the list, the results are\ncomparable to the current state of the art LDPC codes. Luckily, implementing\nsuch a helpful genie is easy.\n  Our list decoder doubles the number of decoding paths at each decoding step,\nand then uses a pruning procedure to discard all but the $L$ \"best\" paths. %In\norder to implement this algorithm, we introduce a natural pruning criterion\nthat can be easily evaluated. Nevertheless, a straightforward implementation\nstill requires $\\Omega(L \\cdot n^2)$ time, which is in stark contrast with the\n$O(n \\log n)$ complexity of the original successive-cancellation decoder. We\nutilize the structure of polar codes to overcome this problem.

This paper develops a new framework for lattice interference\nalignment, based on the compute-and-forward approach. Within this framework,\neach receiver decodes by first recovering two or more linear combinations of\nthe transmitted codewords with integer-valued coefficients and then solving\nthese equations for its desired codeword. For the special case of symmetric\nchannel gains, this framework is used to derive the approximate sum capacity of\nthe Gaussian interference channel, up to an explicitly defined outage set of\nthe channel gains. The key contributions are the capacity lower bounds for the\nweak through strong interference regimes, where each receiver should jointly\ndecode its own codeword along with part of the interfering codewords.

All nodes in the network are assumed to be oblivious to their\nforward channel gains; however, they have perfect information about their\nbackward channel gains. The focus of this paper is on simple, efficient, and\npractical relaying schemes to increase the expected-rate at the destination.\nFor this purpose, various combinations of relaying protocols and the broadcast\napproach (multi-layer coding) are proposed. For the decode-forward (DF)\nrelaying, the maximum finite-layer expected-rate as well as two upper-bounds on\nthe continuous-layer expected-rate are obtained. The main feature of the\nproposed DF scheme is that the layers being decoded at both relays are added\ncoherently at the destination although each relay has no information about the\nnumber of layers being successfully decoded by the other relay. It is proved\nthat the optimal coding scheme is transmitting uncorrelated signals via the\nrelays. Next, the maximum expected-rate of ON/OFF based amplify-forward (AF)\nrelaying is analytically derived. For further performance improvement, a hybrid\ndecode-amplify-forward (DAF) relaying strategy, adopting the broadcast approach\nat the source and relays, is proposed and its maximum throughput and maximum\nfinite-layer expected-rate are presented.

IFD constructs an\nensemble of non-parametric sub-grid field configurations from the combination\nof the data in computer memory, representing constraints on possible field\nconfigurations, and prior assumptions on the sub-grid field statistics. Each of\nthese field configurations can formally be evolved to a later moment since any\ndifferential operator of the dynamics can act on fields living in continuous\nspace. However, these virtually evolved fields need again a representation by\ndata in computer memory. The maximum entropy principle of information theory\nguides the construction of updated datasets via entropic matching, optimally\nrepresenting these field configurations at the later time. The field dynamics\nthereby become represented by a finite set of evolution equations for the data\nthat can be solved numerically. The sub-grid dynamics is treated within an\nauxiliary analytic consideration and the resulting scheme acts solely on the\ndata space. It should provide a more accurate description of the physical field\ndynamics than simulation schemes constructed ad-hoc, due to the more rigorous\naccounting of sub-grid physics and the space discretization process.\nAssimilation of measurement data into an IFD simulation is conceptually\nstraightforward since measurement and simulation data can just be merged. The\nIFD approach is illustrated using the example of a coarsely discretized\nrepresentation of a thermally excited classical Klein-Gordon field.

The idea of interference alignment is\nto coordinate multiple transmitters so that their mutual interference aligns at\nthe receivers, facilitating simple interference cancellation techniques. Since\nIA's inception, researchers have investigated its performance and proposed\nimprovements, verifying IA's ability to achieve the maximum degrees of freedom\n(an approximation of sum capacity) in a variety of settings, developing\nalgorithms for determining alignment solutions, and generalizing transmission\nstrategies that relax the need for perfect alignment but yield better\nperformance. This article provides an overview of the concept of interference\nalignment as well as an assessment of practical issues including performance in\nrealistic propagation environments, the role of channel state information at\nthe transmitter, and the practicality of interference alignment in large\nnetworks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Jun 2012 01:36:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-15", "authors_parsed": [["Ayach", "Omar El", ""], ["Peters", "Steven W.", ""], ["Heath", "Robert W.", "Jr"]]}, {"id": "1206.4767", "submitter": "Pin-Hsun Lin", "authors": "Pin-Hsun Lin and Chien-Li Su and Hsuan-Jung Su", "title": "On the Secrecy Rate Region of a Fading Multiple-Antenna Gaussian\n  Broadcast Channel with Confidential Messages and Partial CSIT", "comments": "6 pages, conference, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we consider the secure transmission over the fast fading\nmultiple antenna Gaussian broadcast channels with confidential messages\n(FMGBC-CM), where a multiple-antenna transmitter sends independent confidential\nmessages to two users with information theoretic secrecy and only the\nstatistics of the receivers' channel state information are known at the\ntransmitter.

Previous approaches to this Quantized Compressed Sensing (QCS)\nproblem based on Gaussian models (bounded l2-norm) for the quantization\ndistortion yield results that, while often acceptable, may not be fully\nconsistent: re-measurement and quantization of the reconstructed signal do not\nnecessarily match the initial observations. Quantization distortion instead\nmore closely resembles heteroscedastic uniform noise, with variance depending\non the observed quantization bin. Generalizing our previous work on uniform\nquantization, we show that for nonuniform quantizers described by the\n\"compander\" formalism, quantization distortion may be better characterized as\nhaving bounded weighted lp-norm (p >= 2), for a particular weighting. We\ndevelop a new reconstruction approach, termed Generalized Basis Pursuit DeNoise\n(GBPDN), which minimizes the sparsity of the reconstructed signal under this\nweighted lp-norm fidelity constraint.
