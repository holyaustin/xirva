The performance of this\nclass of algorithms depends heavily on the tuning of certain threshold\nparameters. In particular, both the final reconstruction error and the\nconvergence rate of the algorithm crucially rely on how the threshold parameter\nis set at each step of the algorithm. In this paper, we propose a\nparameter-free approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm that sets the\nthreshold parameter at each iteration in a fully automatic way without either\nhaving an information about the signal to be reconstructed or needing any\ntuning from the user. We show that the proposed method attains both the minimum\nreconstruction error and the highest convergence rate. Our method is based on\napplying the Stein unbiased risk estimate (SURE) along with a modified gradient\ndescent to find the optimal threshold in each iteration. Motivated by the\nconnections between AMP and LASSO, it could be employed to find the solution of\nthe LASSO for the optimal regularization parameter. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first work concerning parameter tuning that obtains the\nfastest convergence rate with theoretical guarantees.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Oct 2013 21:03:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Mousavi", "Ali", ""], ["Maleki", "Arian", ""], ["Baraniuk", "Richard G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1311.0095", "submitter": "Koujin Takeda", "authors": "Koujin Takeda, Yoshiyuki Kabashima", "title": "Reconstruction algorithm in compressed sensing based on maximum a\n  posteriori estimation", "comments": "11 pages, 5 figures, proceedings of ELC International Meeting on\n  \"Inference, Computation, and Spin Glasses\" (ICSG2013), Sapporo, Japan", "journal-ref": "J.

Since the maximum weight clique problem is known to\nbe NP-hard, we use the heuristic introduced in [2] to discover the maximum\nweight clique in the LG-IDNC graph and finally we compare the decoding delay\nperformance of LG-IDNC and G-IDNC graphs through extensive simulations.\nNumerical results show that our new LG-IDNC graph formulation outperforms the\nG-IDNC graph formulation in all situations and achieves significant improvement\nin the decoding delay especially when the feedback erasure probability is\nhigher than the packet erasure probability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Nov 2013 12:15:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Douik", "Ahmed", ""], ["Sorour", "Sameh", ""], ["Alouini", "Mohamed-Slim", ""], ["Al-Naffouri", "Tareq Y.", ""]]}, {"id": "1311.0461", "submitter": "Krishna Kaipa", "authors": "Krishna Kaipa", "title": "An asymptotic formula in q for the number of [n,k] q-ary MDS codes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.AG math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We obtain an asymptotic formula in q for the number of MDS codes of length n\nand dimension k over a finite field with q elements.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Nov 2013 12:50:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-05", "authors_parsed": [["Kaipa", "Krishna", ""]]}, {"id": "1311.0546", "submitter": "Ernesto Est\\'evez-Rams", "authors": "E.

The vast majority of\ntechnical contributions in the area of relaying neglect hardware impairments\nand, thus, assumes ideal hardware.

This paper quantifies the impact of hardware impairments on\ndual-hop relaying, for both amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward\nprotocols. The outage probability (OP) in these practical scenarios is a\nfunction of the effective end-to-end signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio\n(SNDR).

This paper\nvalidates that the performance loss is small at low rates, but otherwise can be\nvery substantial. In particular, it is proved that for high signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR), the end-to-end SNDR converges to a deterministic constant, coined\nthe SNDR ceiling, which is inversely proportional to the level of impairments.\nThis stands in contrast to the ideal hardware case in which the end-to-end SNDR\ngrows without bound in the high-SNR regime.

We show\nthat TSPR can {\\em provably} recover most $O(n^{1/2-\\eps})$-sparse signals (up\nto a time-shift, conjugate-flip and global phase). We also show that, for most\n$O(n^{1/4-\\eps})$-sparse signals, the recovery is {\\em robust} in the presence\nof measurement noise. Numerical experiments complement our theoretical analysis\nand verify the effectiveness of TSPR.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Nov 2013 12:00:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 13 Nov 2013 15:31:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 14 Nov 2013 06:52:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 1 Jul 2015 14:19:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Jaganathan", "Kishore", ""], ["Oymak", "Samet", ""], ["Hassibi", "Babak", ""]]}, {"id": "1311.2852", "submitter": "Johannes Rauh", "authors": "Nils Bertschinger, Johannes Rauh, Eckehard Olbrich, J\\\"urgen Jost,\n  Nihat Ay", "title": "Quantifying unique information", "comments": "24 pages, 2 figures.

The transmitter performs energy beamforming by using\nan instantaneous channel state information (CSI). The CSI is estimated at the\nreceiver by training via a preamble, and fed back to the transmitter. The\nchannel estimate is more accurate when longer preamble is used, but less time\nis left for wireless power transfer before the channel changes. To maximize the\nharvested energy, in this paper, we address the key challenge of balancing the\ntime resource used for channel estimation and wireless power transfer (WPT),\nand also investigate the allocation of energy resource used for wireless power\ntransfer. First, we consider the general scenario where the preamble length is\nallowed to vary dynamically. Taking into account the effects of imperfect CSI,\nthe optimal preamble length is obtained online by solving a dynamic programming\n(DP) problem. The solution is shown to be a threshold-type policy that depends\nonly on the channel estimate power. Next, we consider the scenario in which the\npreamble length is fixed.

In this paper, we consider the block fading bidirectional relay\nchannel and propose efficient transmission strategies that exploit the block\nfading property of the channel. Thereby, we consider a decode-and-forward relay\nand assume that a direct link between the two users is not present. Our aim is\nto characterize the long-term achievable rate region and to develop protocols\nwhich achieve all points of the obtained rate region. Specifically, in the\nbidirectional relay channel, there exist six possible transmission modes: four\npoint-to-point modes (user 1-to-relay, user 2-to-relay, relay-to-user 1,\nrelay-to-user 2), a multiple-access mode (both users to the relay), and a\nbroadcast mode (the relay to both users). Most existing protocols assume a\nfixed schedule for using a subset of the aforementioned transmission modes.\nMotivated by this limitation, we develop protocols which are not restricted to\nadhere to a predefined schedule for using the transmission modes. In fact,\nbased on the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) of the involved\nlinks, the proposed protocol selects the optimal transmission mode in each time\nslot to maximize the long-term achievable rate region. Thereby, we consider two\ndifferent types of transmit power constraints: 1) a joint long-term power\nconstraint for all nodes, and 2) a fixed transmit power for each node.\nFurthermore, to enable the use of a non-predefined schedule for transmission\nmode selection, the relay has to be equipped with two buffers for storage of\nthe information received from both users. As data buffering increases the\nend-to-end delay, we consider both delay-unconstrained and delay-constrained\ntransmission in the paper.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Nov 2013 09:47:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Jamali", "Vahid", ""], ["Zlatanov", "Nikola", ""], ["Ikhlef", "Aissa", ""], ["Schober", "Robert", ""]]}, {"id": "1311.4369", "submitter": "Sithan  Kanna", "authors": "Dahir H.

The total user transmission power is\nsplit between them and a common message is encoded, which is coherently\ntransmitted by the stations. The decision for a user to choose service with or\nwithout cooperation is directed by a family of geometric policies.

First, we extend the so-called notion\nof instance optimality of a decoder to settings where one only wishes to\nreconstruct some part of the original high dimensional vector from a\nlow-dimensional observation. This covers practical settings such as medical\nimaging of a region of interest, or audio source separation when one is only\ninterested in estimating the contribution of a specific instrument to a musical\nrecording. We define instance optimality relatively to a model much beyond the\ntraditional framework of sparse recovery, and characterize the existence of an\ninstance optimal decoder in terms of joint properties of the model and the\nconsidered linear operator. Noiseless and noise-robust settings are both\nconsidered. We show somewhat surprisingly that the existence of noise-aware\ninstance optimal decoders for all noise levels implies the existence of a\nnoise-blind decoder. A consequence of our results is that for models that are\nrich enough to contain an orthonormal basis, the existence of an L2/L2 instance\noptimal decoder is only possible when the linear operator is not substantially\ndimension-reducing. This covers well-known cases (sparse vectors, low-rank\nmatrices) as well as a number of seemingly new situations (structured sparsity\nand sparse inverse covariance matrices for instance). We exhibit an\noperator-dependent norm which, under a model-specific generalization of the\nRestricted Isometry Property (RIP), always yields a feasible instance\noptimality property.

Based on outage analysis, the\nspatial and temporal diversities are first found sensitive to the received\nsignal qualities of relays, and a link quality control mechanism is then\ndeveloped to prescreen candidate relays in order to explore the diversity of\ncooperative ARQs with a selective and opportunistic AF (SOAF) relaying method.\nAccording to the analysis, the temporal and spatial diversities can be fully\nexploited if proper thresholds are set for each hop along the relaying routes.\nThe SOAF relaying method is further examined from a packet delivery viewpoint.\nBy the principle of the maximum likelihood sequence detection (MLSD),\nsufficient conditions on the link quality are established for the proposed\nSOAF-relaying-based ARQ scheme to attain its potential diversity order in the\npacket error rates (PERs) of MLSD. The conditions depend on the minimum\ncodeword distance and the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore,\nfrom a heuristic viewpoint, we also develop a threshold searching algorithm for\nthe proposed SOAF relaying and link quality method to exploit both the\ndiversity and the SNR gains in PER.
