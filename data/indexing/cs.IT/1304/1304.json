Unfortunately, due\nto physical and computational complexity limitations, we cannot couple and\ndetect hundreds of data streams into and out of the fiber. In order to\ncircumvent this issue, we present input-output coupling schemes that allow the\nuser to couple and extract a reasonable number of signals from a fiber with\nmany modes.

For Gaussian\nrandom measurements, our results indicate that the number of required\nmeasurements is essentially $m = \\mathcal{O}(K \\log \\frac{n}{K})$, which is a\nsignificant improvement over the existing result $m = \\mathcal{O}(K^2 \\log\n\\frac{n}{K})$, especially for large $K$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Apr 2013 12:51:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 28 Nov 2013 16:16:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 4 Apr 2015 15:06:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-15", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Jian", ""], ["Kwon", "Suhyuk", ""], ["Li", "Ping", ""], ["Shim", "Byonghyo", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.1020", "submitter": "Antonis Gotsis", "authors": "Antonis G.

A sparse localization framework is proposed for a\nMIMO array in which transmit and receive elements are placed at random. This\nallows for a dramatic reduction in the number of elements needed, while still\nattaining performance comparable to that of a filled (Nyquist) array. By\nleveraging properties of structured random matrices, we develop a bound on the\ncoherence of the resulting measurement matrix, and obtain conditions under\nwhich the measurement matrix satisfies the so-called isotropy property. The\ncoherence and isotropy concepts are used to establish uniform and non-uniform\nrecovery guarantees within the proposed spatial compressive sensing framework.\nIn particular, we show that non-uniform recovery is guaranteed if the product\nof the number of transmit and receive elements, MN (which is also the number of\ndegrees of freedom), scales with K(log(G))^2, where K is the number of targets\nand G is proportional to the array aperture and determines the angle\nresolution. In contrast with a filled virtual MIMO array where the product MN\nscales linearly with G, the logarithmic dependence on G in the proposed\nframework supports the high-resolution provided by the virtual array aperture\nwhile using a small number of MIMO radar elements. In the numerical results we\nshow that, in the proposed framework, compressive sensing recovery algorithms\nare capable of better performance than classical methods, such as beamforming\nand MUSIC.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 16 Apr 2013 19:54:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 30 Oct 2013 21:39:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Rossi", "Marco", ""], ["Haimovich", "Alexander M.", ""], ["Eldar", "Yonina C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.4610", "submitter": "Yuxin Chen", "authors": "Yuxin Chen, Yuejie Chi", "title": "Spectral Compressed Sensing via Structured Matrix Completion", "comments": "accepted to International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2013)", "journal-ref": "Journal of Machine Learning Research, W&CP 28 (3) :414-422, 2013", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.LG math.IT math.NA stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The paper studies the problem of recovering a spectrally sparse object from a\nsmall number of time domain samples.

In the context of the\nrecently developed theory of compressive sensing (CS), it is often assumed that\nthe signal of interest is sparse in an orthonormal basis. However, in many\npractical applications, this requirement may be too restrictive. A\ngeneralization of the standard sparsity assumption is that the signal lies in a\nunion of subspaces. Recovery of such signals from a small number of samples has\nbeen studied recently in several works. Here, we consider the problem of\nsubspace recovery in which our goal is to identify the subspace (from the\nunion) in which the signal lies using a small number of samples, in the\npresence of noise. More specifically, we derive performance bounds and\nconditions under which reliable subspace recovery is guaranteed using maximum\nlikelihood (ML) estimation. We begin by treating general unions and then obtain\nthe results for the special case in which the subspaces have structure leading\nto block sparsity. In our analysis, we treat both general sampling operators\nand random sampling matrices. With general unions, we show that under certain\nconditions, the number of measurements required for reliable subspace recovery\nin the presence of noise via ML is less than that implied using the restricted\nisometry property which guarantees signal recovery. In the special case of\nblock sparse signals, we quantify the gain achievable over standard sparsity in\nsubspace recovery.

The cost of reduction is defined as the Kullback-Leibler divergence\nrate between a projection of the original process through a partition function\nand a DTMC on the correspondingly partitioned state space. Finding the reduced\nmodel with minimal cost is computationally expensive, as it requires an\nexhaustive search among all state space partitions, and an exact evaluation of\nthe reduction cost for each candidate partition. Our approach deals with the\nlatter problem by minimizing an upper bound on the reduction cost instead of\nminimizing the exact cost; The proposed upper bound is easy to compute and it\nis tight if the original chain is lumpable with respect to the partition. Then,\nwe express the problem in the form of information bottleneck optimization, and\npropose using the agglomerative information bottleneck algorithm for searching\na sub-optimal partition greedily, rather than exhaustively.

However, multi-user MIMO, as originally envisioned with roughly equal\nnumbers of service-antennas and terminals and frequency division duplex\noperation, is not a scalable technology. Massive MIMO (also known as\n\"Large-Scale Antenna Systems\", \"Very Large MIMO\", \"Hyper MIMO\", \"Full-Dimension\nMIMO\" & \"ARGOS\") makes a clean break with current practice through the use of a\nlarge excess of service-antennas over active terminals and time division duplex\noperation. Extra antennas help by focusing energy into ever-smaller regions of\nspace to bring huge improvements in throughput and radiated energy efficiency.\nOther benefits of massive MIMO include the extensive use of inexpensive\nlow-power components, reduced latency, simplification of the media access\ncontrol (MAC) layer, and robustness to intentional jamming. The anticipated\nthroughput depend on the propagation environment providing asymptotically\northogonal channels to the terminals, but so far experiments have not disclosed\nany limitations in this regard. While massive MIMO renders many traditional\nresearch problems irrelevant, it uncovers entirely new problems that urgently\nneed attention: the challenge of making many low-cost low-precision components\nthat work effectively together, acquisition and synchronization for\nnewly-joined terminals, the exploitation of extra degrees of freedom provided\nby the excess of service-antennas, reducing internal power consumption to\nachieve total energy efficiency reductions, and finding new deployment\nscenarios.

The resultant capacity gap is independent of the SNR's of the\nchannels in the network but linear in the total number of nodes.\n  In this paper, we show that if the relays quantize their signals at a\nresolution decreasing with the number of nodes in the network, the additive gap\nto capacity can be made logarithmic in the number of nodes for a class of\nlayered, time-varying wireless relay networks. This suggests that the\nrule-of-thumb to quantize the received signals at the noise level used for\ncompress-and-forward in the current literature can be highly suboptimal.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 27 Apr 2013 00:20:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-30", "authors_parsed": [["Kolte", "Ritesh", ""], ["\u00d6zg\u00fcr", "Ayfer", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.7344", "submitter": "Bobbie Chern", "authors": "Bobbie Chern, Farzan Farnia, Ayfer \\\"Ozg\\\"ur", "title": "On feedback in Gaussian multi-hop networks", "comments": "16 pages; Submitted to Transactions on Information Theory in July\n  2014", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The study of feedback has been mostly limited to single-hop communication\nsettings.

The high SNR bound fits closely into the channel coding theorem: all\ncodes, including capacity-achieving ones, whose decision regions include the\nhardened noise spheres (from the noise sphere hardening argument in the channel\ncoding theorem) satisfies this high SNR requirement and thus has convex error\nrates in both SNR and noise power. We conjecture that all capacity-achieving\ncodes have convex error rates. Convexity properties in signal amplitude and\nnoise power are also investigated. Some applications of the results are\ndiscussed. In particular, it is shown that fading is convexity-preserving and\nis never good in low dimensions under spherically-invariant noise, which may\nalso include any linear diversity combining.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Apr 2013 18:06:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Loyka", "Sergey", ""], ["Kostina", "Victoria", ""], ["Gagnon", "Francois", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.8126", "submitter": "Yuxin Chen", "authors": "Yuxin Chen, Yuejie Chi", "title": "Robust Spectral Compressed Sensing via Structured Matrix Completion", "comments": "accepted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory", "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Vol. 60, No. 10, pp. 6576\n  - 6601, October 2014", "doi": "10.1109/TIT.2014.2343623", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.SY math.IT math.NA stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The paper explores the problem of \\emph{spectral compressed sensing}, which\naims to recover a spectrally sparse signal from a small random subset of its\n$n$ time domain samples. The signal of interest is assumed to be a\nsuperposition of $r$ multi-dimensional complex sinusoids, while the underlying\nfrequencies can assume any \\emph{continuous} values in the normalized frequency\ndomain. Conventional compressed sensing paradigms suffer from the basis\nmismatch issue when imposing a discrete dictionary on the Fourier\nrepresentation. To address this issue, we develop a novel algorithm, called\n\\emph{Enhanced Matrix Completion (EMaC)}, based on structured matrix completion\nthat does not require prior knowledge of the model order. The algorithm starts\nby arranging the data into a low-rank enhanced form exhibiting multi-fold\nHankel structure, and then attempts recovery via nuclear norm minimization.\nUnder mild incoherence conditions, EMaC allows perfect recovery as soon as the\nnumber of samples exceeds the order of $r\\log^{4}n$, and is stable against\nbounded noise. Even if a constant portion of samples are corrupted with\narbitrary magnitude, EMaC still allows exact recovery, provided that the sample\ncomplexity exceeds the order of $r^{2}\\log^{3}n$. Along the way, our results\ndemonstrate the power of convex relaxation in completing a low-rank multi-fold\nHankel or Toeplitz matrix from minimal observed entries. The performance of our\nalgorithm and its applicability to super resolution are further validated by\nnumerical experiments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Apr 2013 19:24:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 22 Jul 2013 16:05:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 17 Mar 2014 04:37:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 18 Mar 2014 05:13:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sun, 20 Jul 2014 21:02:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-05", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Yuxin", ""], ["Chi", "Yuejie", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.8129", "submitter": "Mary Wootters", "authors": "Brett Hemenway, Rafail Ostrovsky and Mary Wootters", "title": "Local Correctability of Expander Codes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work, we present the first local-decoding algorithm for expander\ncodes. This yields a new family of constant-rate codes that can recover from a\nconstant fraction of errors in the codeword symbols, and where any symbol of\nthe codeword can be recovered with high probability by reading $N^\\epsilon$\nsymbols from the corrupted codeword, where $N$ is the block-length of the code.\n  Expander codes, introduced by Sipser and Spielman, are formed from an\nexpander graph $G = (V,E)$ of degree $d$, and an inner code of block-length $d$\nover an alphabet $\\Sigma$. Each edge of the expander graph is associated with a\nsymbol in $\\Sigma$. A string in $\\Sigma^{E}$ will be a codeword if for each\nvertex in $V$, the symbols on the adjacent edges form a codeword in the inner\ncode.\n  We show that if the inner code has a smooth reconstruction algorithm in the\nnoiseless setting, then the corresponding expander code has an efficient\nlocal-correction algorithm in the noisy setting. Instantiating our construction\nwith inner codes based on finite geometries, we obtain novel locally decodable\ncodes with rate approaching one.
