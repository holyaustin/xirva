A particular emphasis is on graph topology\ndefinition based on the correlation and precision matrices of the observed\ndata, combined with additional prior knowledge and structural conditions, such\nas the smoothness or sparsity of graph connections.

The outcome of a test on a subset of items is positive if the subset has\nat least $u$ defective items, negative if it has up to $\\ell$ defective items,\nwhere $0 \\leq \\ell < u$, and arbitrary otherwise. This is called threshold\ngroup testing with a gap. There are a few reported studies on test designs and\ndecoding algorithms for identifying defective items. Most of the previous\nstudies have not been feasible because there are numerous constraints on their\nproblem settings or the decoding complexities of their proposed schemes are\nrelatively large. Therefore, it is compulsory to reduce the number of tests as\nwell as the decoding complexity, i.e., the time for identifying the defective\nitems, for achieving practical schemes.

This outcome results from advances in physics that\nallow storage of more than one bit per cell, coupled with advances in signal\nprocessing that reduce the effect of physical instabilities. Constrained codes\nare used in storage to avoid problematic patterns. Recently, we introduced\nbinary symmetric lexicographically-ordered constrained codes (LOCO codes) for\ndata storage and data transmission. This paper introduces simple constrained\ncodes that support non-binary physical substrates; multi, triple, quad, and the\ncurrently-in-development penta-level cell (M/T/Q/P-LC) Flash memories. The new\ncodes can be easily modified if problematic patterns change with time. These\ncodes are designed to mitigate inter-cell interference, which is a critical\nsource of error in Flash devices. The occurrence of errors is a consequence of\nparasitic capacitances in and across floating gate transistors, resulting in\ncharge propagation from cells being programmed to the highest charge level to\nneighboring cells being programmed to lower levels. The new codes are called\n$q$-ary asymmetric LOCO codes (QA-LOCO codes), and the construction subsumes\ncodes previously designed for single-level cell (SLC) Flash devices (A-LOCO\ncodes). QA-LOCO codes work for a Flash device with any number, $q$, of levels\nper cell. For $q \\geq 4$, we show that QA-LOCO codes can achieve rates greater\nthan $0.95 \\log_2 q$ information bits per coded symbol. The complexity of\nencoding and decoding is modest, and reconfiguring a code is as easy as\nreprogramming an adder. Capacity-achieving rates, affordable encoding-decoding\ncomplexity, and ease of reconfigurability support the growing development of\nM/T/Q/P-LC Flash memory devices, as well as lifecycle management as the\ncharacteristics of these devices change with time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Jan 2020 00:48:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-09", "authors_parsed": [["Hareedy", "Ahmed", ""], ["Dabak", "Beyza", ""], ["Calderbank", "Robert", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.02348", "submitter": "Jiabao Gao", "authors": "Jiabao Gao, Caijun Zhong, Xiaoming Chen, Hai Lin and Zhaoyang Zhang", "title": "Unsupervised Learning for Passive Beamforming", "comments": "5 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT eess.SP math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has recently emerged as a promising\ncandidate to improve the energy and spectral efficiency of wireless\ncommunication systems.

An efficient solution for data aggregation,\ncalled \"over-the-air computation\" (AirComp), embeds functional computation into\nsimultaneous access by many edge devices. Such schemes exploit the waveform\nsuperposition of a multi-access channel to allow an access point to receive a\ndesired function of simultaneous signals. In this work, we aim at realizing\nAirComp in a two-cell multi-antenna system. To this end, a novel scheme of\nsimultaneous signal-and-interference alignment (SIA) is proposed that builds on\nclassic IA to manage interference for multi-cell AirComp. The principle of SIA\nis to divide the spatial channel space into two subspaces with equal\ndimensions: one for signal alignment required by AirComp and the other for\ninter-cell IA. As a result, the number of interference-free spatially\nmultiplexed functional streams received by each AP is maximized (equal to half\nof the available spatial degrees-of-freedom). Furthermore, the number is\nindependent of the population of devices in each cell.

More specifically, their approach uses\na concatenated coding framework with an inner AMP decoder followed by an outer\ntree decoder. In the original implementation, these two components work\nindependently of each other, with the tree decoder acting on the static output\nof the AMP decoder. This article introduces a novel framework where the inner\nAMP decoder and the outer tree decoder operate in tandem, dynamically passing\ninformation back and forth to take full advantage of the underlying CCS\nstructure.

Here, we\nevaluate the RID and DRB for such probability measures. We further provide an\nupper-bound for the RID of multi-dimensional random measures that are obtained\nby Lipschitz functions of component-wise independent discrete-continuous random\nvariables (X). The upper-bound is shown to be achievable when the Lipschitz\nfunction is AX, where A satisfies SPARK(A) = rank(A) + 1 (e.g., Vandermonde\nmatrices). When considering discrete-domain moving-average processes with\nnon-Gaussian excitation noise, the above results allow us to evaluate the\nblock-average RID and DRB, as well as to determine a relationship between these\nparameters and other existing compressibility measures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 12 Jan 2020 08:10:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 8 Mar 2020 08:18:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 28 Sep 2020 20:53:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-30", "authors_parsed": [["Charusaie", "Mohammad-Amin", ""], ["Amini", "Arash", ""], ["Rini", "Stefano", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.03913", "submitter": "Xidong Mu", "authors": "Xidong Mu and Yuanwei Liu and Li Guo and Jiaru Lin and Naofal\n  Al-Dhahir", "title": "Capacity and Optimal Resource Allocation for IRS-assisted Multi-user\n  Communication Systems", "comments": "34 pages, 7 figures, this work is accepted by IEEE Transactions on\n  Wireless Communications", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3062651", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The fundamental capacity limits of intelligent reflecting surface\n(IRS)-assisted multi-user wireless communication systems are investigated in\nthis paper.

By\ncarefully analyzing the evolution of AoI, we derive a closed-form expression of\nthe average AoI for the proposed AoR protocol. We further minimize the average\nAoI by optimizing the generation probability of the status updates at the\nsource. Simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate\nthat the average AoI performance of the proposed AoR protocol is superior to\nthat of the non-cooperative system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 Jan 2020 07:13:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-14", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Bohai", ""], ["Chen", "He", ""], ["Zhou", "Yong", ""], ["Li", "Yonghui", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.04113", "submitter": "Shun Watanabe", "authors": "Shun Watanabe and Te Sun Han", "title": "Isomorphism Problem Revisited: Information Spectrum Approach", "comments": "16 pages, 2 figures; v2 corrected typos", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.DS math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The isomorphism problem in the ergodic theory is revisited from the\nperspective of information spectrum approach, an approach that has been\ndeveloped to investigate coding problems for non-ergodic random processes in\ninformation theory.

First, a converse bound for the caching problem under the constraint of\nuncoded cache placement is proposed based on the \"acyclic index coding converse\nbound\". This converse bound is proved to be achievable by the Maddah-Ali and\nNiesen's scheme when the number of files is not less than the number of users,\nand by a newly derived index coding achievable scheme otherwise. The proposed\nindex coding achievable scheme is based on distributed source coding and\nstrictly improves on the widely used \"composite (index) coding\" achievable\nbound and its improvements, and is of independent interest. An important\nconsequence of the findings of this paper is that advancements on the coded\ncaching problem posed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen are thus only possible by\nconsidering strategies with coded placement phase. A recent work by Yu et al.\nhas however shown that coded cache placement can at most half the network load\ncompared to the results presented in this paper.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Jan 2020 14:42:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-15", "authors_parsed": [["Wan", "Kai", ""], ["Tuninetti", "Daniela", ""], ["Piantanida", "Pablo", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.04812", "submitter": "Julian Renner", "authors": "Sven Puchinger, Julian Renner, Johan Rosenkilde", "title": "Generic Decoding in the Sum-Rank Metric", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose the first non-trivial generic decoding algorithm for codes in the\nsum-rank metric.

The\nmain contribution of this paper is a novel modulation strategy to map the\nmulticast messages generated in the coded caching delivery phase to the symbols\nof a signal constellation, such that users can leverage their cached content to\ndemodulate the desired symbols with higher reliability. For the sake of\nsimplicity, in this paper we focus only on uncoded modulation and\nsymbol-by-symbol error probability. However, our scheme in conjunction with\nmultilevel coded modulation can be extended to channel coding over a larger\nblock lengths.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 16 Jan 2020 13:20:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-17", "authors_parsed": [["Bayat", "Mozhgan", ""], ["Wan", "Kai", ""], ["Ji", "Mingyue", ""], ["Caire", "Giuseppe", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.05787", "submitter": "Takayuki Nozaki", "authors": "Takayuki Nozaki", "title": "Weight Enumerators for Number-Theoretic Codes and Cardinalities of\n  Non-binary VT Codes", "comments": "5 pages, submitted to ISIT2020", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.CO math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper investigates the extended weight enumerators for the\nnumber-theoretic insertion/deletion correcting codes.

Quite often, tight or dual framelets with high vanishing moments\nare constructed through the popular oblique extension principle (OEP).

Here we say that a framelet\ntransform is compact if it can be implemented by convolution using only\nfinitely supported filters. On the other hand, in sharp contrast to the\nextensively studied scalar framelets, multiframelets (a.k.a. vector framelets)\nderived through OEP from refinable vector functions are much less studied and\nare far from well understood. Also, most constructed multiframelets often lack\nbalancing property which reduces sparsity.

In particular, a wireless\nnetwork is considered in which wireless users transmit their local FL models\n(trained using their locally collected data) to a base station (BS). The BS,\nacting as a central controller, generates a global FL model using the received\nlocal FL models and broadcasts it back to all users. Due to the limited number\nof resource blocks (RBs) in a wireless network, only a subset of users can be\nselected to transmit their local FL model parameters to the BS at each learning\nstep. Moreover, since each user has unique training data samples, the BS\nprefers to include all local user FL models to generate a converged global FL\nmodel. Hence, the FL performance and convergence time will be significantly\naffected by the user selection scheme. Therefore, it is necessary to design an\nappropriate user selection scheme that enables users of higher importance to be\nselected more frequently. This joint learning, wireless resource allocation,\nand user selection problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal\nis to minimize the FL convergence time while optimizing the FL performance. To\nsolve this problem, a probabilistic user selection scheme is proposed such that\nthe BS is connected to the users whose local FL models have significant effects\non its global FL model with high probabilities.

Asymptotic analysis shows that the\noutage decreases at $\\left(\\log(\\rho)/\\rho\\right)^L$ rate where $L$ is the\nnumber of elements, whereas the spectral efficiency increases at $\\log(\\rho)$\nrate at large average SINR $\\rho$. For non-reciprocal channels, the minimum\nuser SINR is targeted to be maximized. For single-element RIS, closed-form\nsolution is derived whereas for multiple-element RIS the problem turns out to\nbe non-convex. The latter one is solved through semidefinite programming\nrelaxation and a proposed greedy-iterative method, which can achieve higher\nperformance and lower computational complexity, respectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Jan 2020 08:14:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 3 May 2020 04:06:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-05", "authors_parsed": [["Atapattu", "Saman", ""], ["Fan", "Rongfei", ""], ["Dharmawansa", "Prathapasinghe", ""], ["Wang", "Gongpu", ""], ["Evans", "Jamie", ""], ["Tsiftsis", "Theodoros A.", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.07969", "submitter": "Gianira N.

However, in the\nmultivariate case, the minimax rate depends on the specific allocations of the\ncommunication budgets among the local machines.\n  Although optimal estimation of a Gaussian mean is relatively simple in the\nconventional setting, it is quite involved under the communication constraints,\nboth in terms of the optimal procedure design and lower bound argument. The\ntechniques developed in this paper can be of independent interest. An essential\nstep is the decomposition of the minimax estimation problem into two stages,\nlocalization and refinement. This critical decomposition provides a framework\nfor both the lower bound analysis and optimal procedure design.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Jan 2020 04:19:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-11", "authors_parsed": [["Cai", "T.

To generate it, we used an NR-compliant\nlink-level simulator to calibrate the EESM method as well as to obtain\nSINR-block error rate (BLER) lookup tables for various NR configurations. We\nalso illustrate the usability of the developed model through end-to-end\nsimulations in ns-3, under different NR settings of modulation and coding\nschemes, hybrid automatic repeat request combining methods, and link adaptation\napproaches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Jan 2020 13:24:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 19 Apr 2021 07:58:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["Lagen", "Sandra", ""], ["Wanuga", "Kevin", ""], ["Elkotby", "Hussain", ""], ["Goyal", "Sanjay", ""], ["Patriciello", "Natale", ""], ["Giupponi", "Lorenza", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.10318", "submitter": "Nikolaos Nikolaou", "authors": "Nikolaos Nikolaou, Henry Reeve, Gavin Brown", "title": "Margin Maximization as Lossless Maximal Compression", "comments": "19 pages Main Paper + 7 pages Supplementary Material, 7 Figures,\n  Submitted to the Machine Learning journal (11/11/19)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.IT math.IT stat.ML", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  The ultimate goal of a supervised learning algorithm is to produce models\nconstructed on the training data that can generalize well to new examples.

We consider a general\nnoise model where the accuracy of answers on queries changes depending both on\nthe worker (the data provider) and query degree $d$. For this general model, we\ncharacterize the information-theoretic limit on the optimal number of queries\nto reliably recover $m$ labels in terms of a given combination of degree-$d$\nqueries and noise parameters. Further, we propose an efficient inference\nalgorithm that achieves this limit even when the noise parameters are unknown.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jan 2020 11:23:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 30 Apr 2021 05:39:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-03", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Daesung", ""], ["Chung", "Hye Won", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.11783", "submitter": "Yi Zhong", "authors": "Yi Zhong, Guoqiang Mao, Xiaohu Ge, Fu-Chun Zheng", "title": "Spatio-temporal Modeling for Massive and Sporadic Access", "comments": "IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, accepted to appear", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.NI math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The vision for smart city imperiously appeals to the implementation of\nInternet-of-Things (IoT), some features of which, such as massive access and\nbursty short packet transmissions, require new methods to enable the cellular\nsystem to seamlessly support its integration.

Closed-form\nexpressions of the transmission success probability and network connection\ndensity are presented for several UNB protocols.
