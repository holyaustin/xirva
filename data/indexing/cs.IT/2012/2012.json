Each user has access to $L$\nneighbouring cache-nodes with a cyclic wrap-around topology. The coded caching\nscheme proposed by Hachem et al. suffers from the case that $L$ does not divide\n$K$, where the needed number of transmissions (a.k.a. load) is at most four\ntimes the load expression for the case where $L$ divides $K$.\n  Our main contribution is to propose a novel {\\it transformation} approach to\nsmartly extend the schemes satisfying some conditions for the well known\nshared-link caching systems to the multiaccess caching systems. Then we can get\nmany coded caching schemes with different subpacketizations for multiaccess\ncoded caching system.

As being operated in the interference-limited regime, the aggregate\ninterference resulted from the increasing mmWave APs will gradually become the\nnetwork performance bottleneck, which leads to the saturation of the\nthroughput. In this paper, we propose to overcome the densification plateau of\na mmWave network by employing spatial multiplexing at APs. To study the effect\nof spatial multiplexing on mmWave networks, we first derive the coverage\nprobability as a function of spatial multiplexing gain. The fixed-rate coding\nscheme is then used to provide the network throughput. We also introduce the\nconcept of densification gain to capture the improvement in network throughput\nachieved through the AP densification. Our results indicate that without the\nspatial multiplexing at APs, the throughput of mmWave networks will reach the\nplateau when the density of APs becomes sufficiently large. By enabling the\nspatial multiplexing at APs, however, the mmWave network can continuously\nharvest the throughput gains as the number of APs grows.

In addition to conventional $\\ell_2$\nperturbation analysis, we present a systematic $\\ell_{\\infty}$ and\n$\\ell_{2,\\infty}$ perturbation theory for eigenspace and singular subspaces,\nwhich has only recently become available owing to a powerful \"leave-one-out\"\nanalysis framework.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Dec 2020 18:40:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-16", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Yuxin", ""], ["Chi", "Yuejie", ""], ["Fan", "Jianqing", ""], ["Ma", "Cong", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.08682", "submitter": "Eray Unsal Atay", "authors": "Eray Unsal Atay, Igor Kadota and Eytan Modiano", "title": "Aging Bandits: Regret Analysis and Order-Optimal Learning Algorithm for\n  Wireless Networks with Stochastic Arrivals", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "eess.SY cs.IT cs.LG cs.SY math.IT stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a single-hop wireless network with sources transmitting\ntime-sensitive information to the destination over multiple unreliable\nchannels.

The more the entropy, the more likelihood of transition challenges.\nUsers can utilize the suggested techniques as a guide to prioritize training\nefforts to improve documentation and increase the chances of accurate coding,\ncode validity, and longitudinal data comparisons.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Dec 2020 06:16:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-24", "authors_parsed": [["Niyirora", "Jerome", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.12551", "submitter": "Yair Noam", "authors": "Niv Arad and Yair Noam", "title": "C-RAN Zero-Forcing with Imperfect CSI: Analysis and Precode\\&Quantize\n  Feedback", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Downlink joint transmission by a cluster of remote radio heads (RRHs) is an\nessential technique for enhancing throughput in future cellular networks.

To do so, existing\nsolutions mostly rely on explicit coordination between the transmitter (TX) and\nthe receiver (RX), which significantly reduces the airtime available for\ncommunication and further complicates the network protocol design. This paper\nadvances the state of the art by presenting DeepBeam, a framework for beam\nmanagement that does not require pilot sequences from the TX, nor any beam\nsweeping or synchronization from the RX. This is achieved by inferring (i) the\nAngle of Arrival (AoA) of the beam and (ii) the actual beam being used by the\ntransmitter through waveform-level deep learning on ongoing transmissions\nbetween the TX to other receivers. In this way, the RX can associate\nSignal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) levels to beams without explicit coordination with\nthe TX. This is possible because different beam patterns introduce different\nimpairments to the waveform, which can be subsequently learned by a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN).

Further,\nwe collect existing results to provide a variational representation of\nintermediate RD or TVO distributions as a minimizing an expectation of KL\ndivergences. This solution also corresponds to a size-power tradeoff using the\nlikelihood ratio test and the Neyman Pearson lemma. In thermodynamic\nintegration bounds such as the TVO, we identify the intermediate distribution\nwhose expected sufficient statistics match the log partition function.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Dec 2020 07:13:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 15 Jan 2021 06:06:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-18", "authors_parsed": [["Brekelmans", "Rob", ""], ["Nielsen", "Frank", ""], ["Makhzani", "Alireza", ""], ["Galstyan", "Aram", ""], ["Steeg", "Greg Ver", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.15615", "submitter": "Samith Abeywickrama", "authors": "Samith Abeywickrama, Rui Zhang, and Chau Yuen", "title": "Refined Nonlinear Rectenna Modeling and Optimal Waveform Design for\n  Multi-User Multi-Antenna Wireless Power Transfer", "comments": "Submitted for possible journal publication", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we study the optimal waveform design for wireless power\ntransfer (WPT) from a multi-antenna energy transmitter (ET) to multiple\nsingle-antenna energy receivers (ERs) simultaneously in multi-path\nfrequency-selective channels.

A sample can be perfectly\nunlearned if we retrain all models that used it from scratch with that sample\nremoved from their training dataset.
