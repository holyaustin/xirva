Based on a\nRician model for the LoS channels, we show, analytically and numerically, that\nLoS interference hinders the achievable secondary user capacity when\ninterference constraints are imposed at the primary user receiver. This is\ncaused by the poor dynamic range of the interference channels fluctuations when\na dominant LoS component exists. In order to improve the capacity of such\nsystem, we propose the usage of an Electronically Steerable Parasitic Array\nRadiator (ESPAR) antennas at the secondary terminals. An ESPAR antenna involves\na single RF chain and has a reconfigurable radiation pattern that is controlled\nby assigning arbitrary weights to M orthonormal basis radiation patterns via\naltering a set of reactive loads. By viewing the orthonormal patterns as\nmultiple virtual dumb antennas, we randomly vary their weights over time\ncreating artificial channel fluctuations that can perfectly eliminate the\nundesired impact of LoS interference. This scheme is termed as Random Aerial\nBeamforming (RAB), and is well suited for compact and low cost mobile terminals\nas it uses a single RF chain. Moreover, we investigate the exposed secondary\nusers problem in a multiuser setting, showing that LoS interference hinders\nmultiuser interference diversity and affects the growth rate of the SU capacity\nas a function of the number of users. Using RAB, we show that LoS interference\ncan actually be exploited to improve multiuser diversity via opportunistic\nnulling.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Jun 2014 16:10:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 1 Aug 2015 09:00:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-04", "authors_parsed": [["Alaa", "Ahmed M.", ""], ["Ismail", "Mahmoud H.", ""], ["Tawfik", "Hazim", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.1725", "submitter": "Leo Yu Zhang", "authors": "Leo Yu Zhang, Kwok-Wo Wong, Yushu Zhang, Jiantao Zhou", "title": "Bi-level Protected Compressive Sampling", "comments": "14 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TMM.2016.2581593", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Some pioneering works have investigated embedding cryptographic properties in\ncompressive sampling (CS) in a way similar to one-time pad symmetric cipher.\nThis paper tackles the problem of constructing a CS-based symmetric cipher\nunder the key reuse circumstance, i.e., the cipher is resistant to common\nattacks even a fixed measurement matrix is used multiple times.

The\nsupport for high data rates has been the main objective in recent years, as\nseen from the academic focus on sum-rate optimization and the efforts from\nstandardization bodies to meet the peak rate requirements specified in\nIMT-Advanced. In contrast, a variety of metrics/objectives are put forward in\nthe technological preparations for 5G networks: higher peak rates, improved\ncoverage with uniform user experience, higher reliability and lower latency,\nbetter energy efficiency, lower-cost user devices and services, better\nscalability with number of devices, etc. These multiple objectives are coupled,\noften in a conflicting manner such that improvements in one objective lead to\ndegradation in the other objectives. Hence, the design of future networks calls\nfor new optimization tools that properly handle the existence and tradeoffs\nbetween multiple objectives.\n  In this article, we provide a review of multi-objective optimization (MOO),\nwhich is a mathematical framework to solve design problems with multiple\nconflicting objectives.

For the latter, a new compressed sensing\napproach is also presented.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Jun 2014 21:34:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 5 Jul 2014 13:07:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["Roman", "Bogdan", ""], ["Hansen", "Anders", ""], ["Adcock", "Ben", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.4212", "submitter": "Fabio Brochero Martinez", "authors": "F.E.

Specifically, the optimal user\nscheduling is designed by assuming that the channel state information (CSI) of\nall links from CUs to CBS, to primary user (PU) and to eavesdroppers are\navailable. By contrast, the suboptimal user scheduling only requires the CSI of\nCUs-CBS links without the PU's and eavesdroppers' CSI.

We attempt to answer these questions in the\npresent paper by focusing on the estimation of bandable covariance matrices\nwhen $p>n$ but $\\log(p)=o(n)$. Motivated by the deep connection between Stein's\nunbiased risk estimation (SURE) and AIC in regression models, we propose a\nfamily of generalized SURE ($\\text{SURE}_c$) indexed by $c$ for covariance\nmatrix estimation, where $c$ is some constant. When $c$ is 2, $\\text{SURE}_2$\nprovides an unbiased estimator of the Frobenious risk of the covariance matrix\nestimator. Furthermore, we show that by minimizing $\\text{SURE}_2$ over all\npossible banding covariance matrix estimators we attain the minimax optimal\nrate of convergence and the resulting estimator behaves like the covariance\nmatrix estimator obtained by the so-called oracle tuning.

For such a cognitive network, there are two important and limited\nresources that should be distributed in a comprehensive manner, namely feedback\nbits and time duration. First, regarding the feedback bits, there are two\ncomponents: sensing component (used to convey various users' sensing results)\nand accessing component (used to feedback channel state information). A large\nsensing component can support more users to perform cooperative sensing, which\nresults in high sensing precision. However, a large accessing component is\npreferred as well, as it has a direct impact on the performance in the\nmultiuser cognitive network when multi-antenna technique, such as zero-forcing\nbeamforming (ZFBF), is utilized. Second, the tradeoff of sensing and accessing\nduration in a transmission interval needs to be determined, so that the sum\ntransmission rate is optimized while satisfying the interference constraint. In\naddition, the above two resources are interrelated and inversive under some\nconditions. Specifically, sensing time can be saved by utilizing more sensing\nfeedback bits for a given performance objective. Hence, the resources should be\nallocation in a jointly manner. Based on the joint optimization framework and\nthe intrinsic relationship between the two resources, we propose two joint\nresource allocation schemes by maximizing the average sum transmission rate in\na multiuser multi-antenna cognitive network.
