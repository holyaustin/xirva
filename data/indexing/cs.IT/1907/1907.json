The results reveal that adding common randomness at\nthe transmitters is a powerful way to remove the secrecy constraints in\ncommunication networks in terms of GDoF performance. Common randomness can be\ngenerated offline. The role of the common randomness is to jam the information\nsignal at the eavesdroppers, without causing too much interference at the\nlegitimate receivers.

Indoor wireless optical backhauling is a novel\napproach whereby the interconnections between adjacent LiFi BSs are provided by\nway of directed line-of-sight (LOS) wireless infrared (IR) links. Building on\nthe aforesaid approach, this paper presents the top-down design of a multi-hop\nwireless backhaul configuration for multi-tier optical attocell networks by\nproposing the novel idea of super cells. Such cells incorporate multiple\nclusters of attocells that are connected to the core network via a single\ngateway based on multi-hop decode-and-forward (DF) relaying. Consequently, new\nchallenges arise for managing the bandwidth and power resources of the\nbottleneck backhaul. By putting forward user-based bandwidth scheduling (UBS)\nand cell-based bandwidth scheduling (CBS) policies, the system-level modeling\nand analysis of the end-to-end multi-user sum rate is elaborated. In addition,\noptimal bandwidth scheduling under both UBS and CBS policies are formulated as\nconstrained convex optimization problems, which are solved by using the\nprojected subgradient method. Furthermore, the transmission power of the\nbackhaul system is opportunistically reduced by way of an innovative fixed\npower control (FPC) strategy. The notion of backhaul bottleneck occurrence\n(BBO) is introduced. An accurate approximate expression of the probability of\nBBO is derived, and then verified using Monte Carlo simulations.

The key constituents of the channel\nresource theory are quantum channel boxes, consisting of a pair of quantum\nchannels, which can be manipulated for free by means of an arbitrary quantum\nsuperchannel (the most general physical transformation of a quantum channel).\nOne main question of the resource theory is the approximate channel box\ntransformation problem, in which the goal is to transform an initial channel\nbox (or boxes) to a final channel box (or boxes), while allowing for an\nasymmetric error in the transformation. The channel resource theory is richer\nthan its counterpart for states because there is a wider variety of ways in\nwhich this question can be framed, either in the one-shot or $n$-shot regimes,\nwith the latter having parallel and sequential variants.

As a result, we obtain\nclosed-form theoretical expressions linking fundamental system design and\nenvironment parameters with the power consumption of analog front ends for\ncommunication receivers. This collection of scaling laws and bounds is meant to\nserve as a theoretical reference for practical low power front end design. In\none set of results, we first find that the front end power consumption scales\nat least as SNDR^3/2 if environment parameters (fading and blocker levels) are\nstatic. The obtained scaling law is subsequently used to derive relations\nbetween front end power consumption and several other important communication\nsystem parameters, namely, digital modulation constellation size, symbol error\nprobability, error control coding gain and coding rate. Such relations, in\nturn, can be used when deciding which system design strategies to adopt for\nlow-power applications. For example, if error control coding is employed, the\nmost energy-efficient strategy for the entire receiver is to use codes with\nmoderate coding gain and simple decoding algorithms, such as convolutional\ncodes. In another collection of results, we find how front end power scales\nwith environment parameters if the performance is kept constant. This yields\nbounds on average power reduction of receivers that adapt to the communication\nenvironment. For instance, if a receiver front end adapts to fading\nfluctuations while keeping the performance above some given minimum\nrequirement, power can theoretically be reduced at least 20x compared to a\nnon-adaptive front end.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Jul 2019 21:30:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-17", "authors_parsed": [["Sarajli\u0107", "Muris", ""], ["Liu", "Liang", ""], ["Sj\u00f6land", "Henrik", ""], ["Edfors", "Ove", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.07148", "submitter": "Ping Li", "authors": "Martin Slawski, Emanuel Ben-David, Ping Li", "title": "A Two-Stage Approach to Multivariate Linear Regression with Sparsely\n  Mismatched Data", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ML cs.IT cs.LG math.IT stat.ME", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A tacit assumption in linear regression is that (response, predictor)-pairs\ncorrespond to identical observational units.

A set of $k$ blocks to be\nstored is encoded using an $[n, k]$ code to generate $n$ blocks that are then\nstored on different storage nodes. The redundancy configuration is chosen based\non the failure rates of storage devices, and is typically kept constant.\nHowever, a recent work by Kadekodi et al. shows that the failure rate of\nstorage devices vary significantly over time, and that adapting the redundancy\nconfiguration in response to such variations provides significant benefits.\nConverting the redundancy configuration of already encoded data by re-encoding\nrequires significant overhead on resources such as accesses, device IO, network\nbandwidth, and compute cycles.\n  In this work, we first present a framework to formalize the notion of code\nconversion: the process of converting data encoded with an $[n^I, k^I]$ code\ninto data encoded with an $[n^F, k^F]$ code while maintaining desired\ndecodability properties, such as the maximum-distance-separable (MDS) property.\nWe then introduce convertible codes, a new class of codes that allow for code\nconversions in a resource-efficient manner. For an important parameter regime\n(which we call the merge regime) along with the linearity and MDS decodability\nconstraint, we prove tight bounds on the number of nodes accessed during code\nconversion. In particular, our achievability result is an explicit construction\nof MDS convertible codes that are optimal for all parameter values in the merge\nregime albeit with a high field size.
