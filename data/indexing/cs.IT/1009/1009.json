Since four information symbols taken from an\nM-QAM constellation are selected to construct one Golden Code codeword, a\nmaximum likelihood decoder using sphere decoding has the worst-case complexity\nof O(M^4), when the Channel State Information (CSI) is available at the\nreceiver. Previously, this worst-case complexity was reduced to O(M^(2.5))\nwithout performance degradation. When the CSI is known by the transmitter as\nwell as the receiver, beamforming techniques that employ singular value\ndecomposition are commonly used in MIMO systems. In the absence of channel\ncoding, when a single symbol is transmitted, these systems achieve the full\ndiversity order provided by the channel. Whereas this property is lost when\nmultiple symbols are simultaneously transmitted. However, uncoded multiple\nbeamforming can achieve the full diversity order by adding a properly designed\nconstellation precoder. For 2 \\times 2 Fully Precoded Multiple Beamforming\n(FPMB), the general worst-case decoding complexity is O(M). In this paper,\nGolden Coded Multiple Beamforming (GCMB) is proposed, which transmits the\nGolden Code through 2 \\times 2 multiple beamforming. GCMB achieves the full\ndiversity order and its performance is similar to general MIMO systems using\nthe Golden Code and FPMB, whereas the worst-case decoding complexity of\nO(sqrt(M)) is much lower. The extension of GCMB to larger dimensions is also\ndiscussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Aug 2010 23:15:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-17", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Boyu", ""], ["Ayanoglu", "Ender", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.0068", "submitter": "Wei Yang", "authors": "Wei Yang, Lihua Li, Gang Wu, Haifeng Wang, and Ying Wang", "title": "Joint Uplink and Downlink Relay Selection in Cooperative Cellular\n  Networks", "comments": "Accepted by VTC-2010FALL", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider relay selection technique in a cooperative cellular network where\nuser terminals act as mobile relays to help the communications between base\nstation (BS) and mobile station (MS).

Based on this observation, a coding strategy is proposed to improve\nthe rate of both users at the same time using a relay node in an interference\nchannel.

It\ninvolves grouping subsets of items into different pools and detecting defective\nmembers based on the set of test results obtained for each pool.\n  In a classical noiseless group testing setup, it is assumed that the sampling\nprocedure is fully known to the reconstruction algorithm, in the sense that the\nexistence of a defective member in a pool results in the test outcome of that\npool to be positive. However, this may not be always a valid assumption in some\ncases of interest. In particular, we consider the case where the defective\nitems in a pool can become independently inactive with a certain probability.\nHence, one may obtain a negative test result in a pool despite containing some\ndefective items. As a result, any sampling and reconstruction method should be\nable to cope with two different types of uncertainty, i.e., the unknown set of\ndefective items and the partially unknown, probabilistic testing procedure.\n  In this work, motivated by the application of detecting infected people in\nviral epidemics, we design non-adaptive sampling procedures that allow\nsuccessful identification of the defective items through a set of probabilistic\ntests. Our design requires only a small number of tests to single out the\ndefective items.

In particular, we focus on a model where the entries of the unknown\nvector fall into two sets, with entries of each set having a specific\nprobability of being nonzero. We propose a weighted $\\ell_1$ minimization\nrecovery algorithm and analyze its performance using a Grassmann angle\napproach. We compute explicitly the relationship between the system\nparameters-the weights, the number of measurements, the size of the two sets,\nthe probabilities of being nonzero- so that when i.i.d. random Gaussian\nmeasurement matrices are used, the weighted $\\ell_1$ minimization recovers a\nrandomly selected signal drawn from the considered sparsity model with\noverwhelming probability as the problem dimension increases. This allows us to\ncompute the optimal weights. We demonstrate through rigorous analysis and\nsimulations that for the case when the support of the signal can be divided\ninto two different subclasses with unequal sparsity fractions, the optimal\nweighted $\\ell_1$ minimization outperforms the regular $\\ell_1$ minimization\nsubstantially.

Using a standard LDPC ensemble with a given threshold over the\nBEC, we give a construction for a two edge type LDPC ensemble with the same\nthreshold.

It can offer high quality\nperformance in terms of bandwidth efficiency, robustness against multipath\nfading and cost-effective implementation. However, its main disadvantage is the\nhigh peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the output signal. As a result, a\nlinear behavior of the system over a large dynamic range is needed and\ntherefore the efficiency of the output amplifier is reduced. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the effect of some of these sets of time waveforms on the OFDM\nsystem performance in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER). We evaluate the system\nperformance in AWGN channels. The obtained results indicate that the reduction\nin PAPR of the investigated methods is associated with considerable improvement\nin BER performance of the system, in multipath channels, as compared to\nconventional OFDM. These promising results indicate that pulse shaping with\nreduced PAPR is an attractive solution for an OFDM system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 25 Sep 2010 05:39:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-28", "authors_parsed": [["Kamruzzaman", "S.

The last\ncentury saw several significant fundamental advances in our understanding of\nthe process of inference, which make it clear that these are inferential\ntheories. That is, rather than being a description of the behavior of the\nuniverse, these theories describe how observers can make optimal predictions\nabout the universe. In such a picture, information plays a critical role. What\nis more is that little clues, such as the fact that black holes have entropy,\ncontinue to suggest that information is fundamental to physics in general.\n  In the last decade, our fundamental understanding of probability theory has\nled to a Bayesian revolution. In addition, we have come to recognize that the\nfoundations go far deeper and that Cox's approach of generalizing a Boolean\nalgebra to a probability calculus is the first specific example of the more\nfundamental idea of assigning valuations to partially-ordered sets. By\nconsidering this as a natural way to introduce quantification to the more\nfundamental notion of ordering, one obtains an entirely new way of deriving\nphysical laws. I will introduce this new way of thinking by demonstrating how\none can quantify partially-ordered sets and, in the process, derive physical\nlaws. The implication is that physical law does not reflect the order in the\nuniverse, instead it is derived from the order imposed by our description of\nthe universe.

For one-hop traffic, delay is\ndefined to be order-optimal if it is O(1), i.e., it stays bounded, as the\nnetwork-size increases to infinity. Using mean field theory techniques, we\nanalytically show that for torus (grid-like) interference topologies with\none-hop traffic, to achieve a network load of $\\rho$, the delay under U-CSMA\npolicy becomes $O(1/(1-\\rho)^{3})$ as the network-size increases, and hence,\ndelay becomes order optimal. We conduct simulations for general random\ngeometric interference topologies under U-CSMA policy combined with congestion\ncontrol to maximize a network-wide utility. These simulations confirm that\norder optimality holds, and that we can use U-CSMA policy jointly with\ncongestion control to operate close to the optimal utility with a low packet\ndelay in arbitrarily large random geometric topologies.
