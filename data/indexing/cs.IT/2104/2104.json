In the considered model, each IoT device monitors a\nphysical process that follows nonlinear dynamics. As the dynamics of the\nphysical process vary over time, each device must find an optimal sampling\nfrequency to sample the real-time dynamics of the physical system and send\nsampled information to a base station (BS). Due to limited wireless resources,\nthe BS can only select a subset of devices to transmit their sampled\ninformation. Meanwhile, changing the sampling frequency will also impact the\nenergy used by each device for sampling and information transmission. Thus, it\nis necessary to jointly optimize the sampling policy of each device and the\ndevice selection scheme of the BS so as to accurately monitor the dynamics of\nthe physical process using minimum energy. This problem is formulated as an\noptimization problem whose goal is to minimize the weighted sum of AoI cost and\nenergy consumption. To solve this problem, a distributed reinforcement learning\napproach is proposed to optimize the sampling policy. The proposed learning\nmethod enables the IoT devices to find the optimal sampling policy using their\nlocal observations. Given the sampling policy, the device selection scheme can\nbe optimized so as to minimize the weighted sum of AoI and energy consumption\nof all devices.

Specifically, we consider a practical system model where the RISs with\ndifferent geometric sizes are distributively deployed, and wireless channels\nassociated to different RISs are assumed to be independent but not identically\ndistributed (i.n.i.d.). We propose two purpose-oriented multi-RIS-aided\nschemes, namely, the exhaustive RIS-aided (ERA) and opportunistic RIS-aided\n(ORA) schemes. In the ERA scheme, all RISs participate in assisting the\ncommunication of a pair of transceivers, whereas in the ORA scheme, only the\nmost appropriate RIS participates and the remaining RISs are utilized for other\npurposes. A mathematical framework, which relies on the method of moments, is\nproposed to statistically characterize the end-to-end (e2e) channels of these\nschemes. It is shown that either a Gamma distribution or a LogNormal\ndistribution can be used to approximate the distribution of the magnitude of\nthe e2e channel coefficients in both schemes. With these findings, we evaluate\nthe performance of the two schemes in terms of outage probability (OP) and\nergodic capacity (EC), where tight approximate closed-form expressions for the\nOP and EC are derived. Representative results show that the ERA scheme\noutperforms the ORA scheme in terms of OP and EC.

Using a dynamic programming\nframework we derive the structure of the optimal procedure, which minimizes the\naverage detection delay (ADD) subject to a false alarm probability upper bound.\nIn the rare event regime, the optimal procedure converges to a more practical\nthreshold test on the posterior probability of the change point. A convenient\nrecursive computation of this posterior probability is derived by using the\npropagation pattern of the spatial event. The ADD of the posterior probability\nthreshold test is analyzed in the asymptotic regime.

In the literature on streaming codes, the\ncommonly-assumed Gilbert-Elliott channel model, is replaced by a more\ntractable, delay-constrained, sliding-window (DCSW) channel model that can\nintroduce either random or burst erasures. The known streaming codes that are\nrate optimal over the DCSW channel model are constructed by diagonally\nembedding a scalar block code across successive packets. These code\nconstructions have field size that is quadratic in the delay parameter $\\tau$\nand have a somewhat complex structure with an involved decoding procedure. This\nled to the introduction of simple streaming (SS) codes in which diagonal\nembedding is replaced by staggered-diagonal embedding (SDE). The SDE approach\nreduces the impact of a burst of erasures and makes it possible to construct\nnear-rate-optimal streaming codes using Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) code\nhaving linear field size. The present paper takes this development one step\nfurther, by retaining the staggered-diagonal feature, but permitting the\nplacement of more than one code symbol from a given scalar codeword within each\npacket. These generalized, simple streaming codes allow us to improve upon the\nrate of SS codes, while retaining the simplicity of working with MDS codes.

A major challenge of SWIPT is the\nenergy consumption of the receiver of such low-power devices. An attractive\nlow-power solution consists in an integrated information decoder (ID) and\nenergy harvester (EH) architecture for SWIPT receiver (IntRx) where the\nreceived RF signal is first rectified before being used for information\ndecoding. Such architecture eliminates the need for energy-consuming RF\ncomponents such as local oscillators and mixers. This paper proposes a novel\nmodulation and demodulation method for the IntRx SWIPT architecture based on\npulse position modulation (PPM) where information is encoded in the position of\nthe pulse. The new method transmits high amplitude pulses to increase the\nPeak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of the transmit signal and exploits the EH's\nnonlinearity so as to boost the harvested DC power. Simultaneously, the\ninformation can be decoded from the rectifier signal by simply finding the\nposition of the pulse in a certain symbol duration. We have analyzed both the\ninformation and the power transfer performance of the newly proposed PPM for\nIntRx SWIPT theoretically, numerically, and experimentally. To that end, we\nhave established a SWIPT system testbed in an indoor environment by prototyping\na base station to transfer information-power signal and the IntRx SWIPT\nreceiver including ID and EH blocks. The performance evaluation of the PPM was\ncarried out in various conditions, and the results have been compared and\ncontrasted to conventional signals. Theoretical, numerical, and experimental\nresults highlight the significant benefits of the proposed PPM scheme to\nenhance the power transfer performance and operate information decoding with\nlow-power consumption.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 16 Apr 2021 23:25:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Junghoon", ""], ["Clerckx", "Bruno", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.08417", "submitter": "Mohanad Obeed", "authors": "Mohanad Obeed and Anas Chaaban", "title": "Joint Beamforming Design for Multiuser MISO Downlink Aided by a\n  Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface and a Relay", "comments": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2104.02849", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/", "abstract": "  Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have drawn considerable attention\nrecently due to their controllable scattering elements that are able to direct\nelectromagnetic waves into desirable directions.

SM makes the polar code design\ndifficult as the spatial bits actually select a channel index for transmission.\nTo solve this problem, we propose a Monte Carlo based evaluation of the ergodic\ncapacities for the individual bit levels under the capacity rule for a\nspace-shift keying (SSK) system, where we also make use of a single antenna\nactivation to approximate the transmission channel for the design of the\nmultilevel polar code. Our simulation results show that the multilevel polar\ncoded 16 $\\times$ 1 SSK system outperforms the corresponding system that uses\nbit-interleaved polar coded modulation by 2.9 dB at a bit-error rate (BER) of\n$10^{-4}$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 Apr 2021 10:12:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-21", "authors_parsed": [["Hasan", "Muhammad Zaeem", "", "School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College Dublin,\n  Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland"], ["Perovi\u0107", "Nemanja Stefan", "", "School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College Dublin,\n  Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland"], ["Flanagan", "Mark F.", "", "School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College Dublin,\n  Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland"]]}, {"id": "2104.09925", "submitter": "Benjamin Rosen", "authors": "Benjamin Rosen, Adnan M.

These expressions are then used to formulate\npower optimization problems with two throughput fairness criteria: i)\nnetwork-wide max-min fairness, and ii) per-cell max-min fairness. Furthermore,\nwe provide centralized and decentralized power control strategies to optimize\nthe transmit powers in the network. We demonstrate that employing sectorized\nantenna elements mitigates the detrimental effects of pilot contamination by\nrejecting a portion of interfering pilots in the spatial domain during channel\nestimation phase. Simulation results with practical sectorized antennas reveal\nthat sectorization and multi-point coordination combined with sectorization\nlead to more than 1.7x and 2.6x improvements in the 95%-likely per-user\nthroughput, respectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Apr 2021 00:40:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-23", "authors_parsed": [["Shahsavari", "Shahram", ""], ["Nosrati", "Mehrdad", ""], ["Hassanzadeh", "Parisa", ""], ["Ashikhmin", "Alexei", ""], ["Marzetta", "Thomas L.", ""], ["Erkip", "Elza", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.10841", "submitter": "Huang Meng", "authors": "Meng Huang and Zhiqiang Xu", "title": "Uniqueness and stability for the solution of a nonlinear least squares\n  problem", "comments": "22 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.IT cs.NA math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we focus on the nonlinear least squares:\n$\\mbox{min}_{\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{H}^d}\\| |A\\mathbf{x}|-\\mathbf{b}\\|$ where\n$A\\in \\mathbb{H}^{m\\times d}$, $\\mathbf{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ with $\\mathbb{H}\n\\in \\{\\mathbb{R},\\mathbb{C} \\}$ and consider the uniqueness and stability of\nsolutions.

The idea is to reduce/null the energy costs to be paid by\nenergy harvesting (EH) IoT nodes from participating in large-scale\ntime/power-consuming CSI training, but still enable some transmit spatial\ngains. In this paper, we take another step forward by proposing a novel\nCSI-free rotary antenna beamforming (RAB) WET scheme that outperforms all\nstate-of-the-art CSI-free schemes in a scenario where a power beacon (PB)\nequipped with a uniform linear array (ULA) powers a large set of surrounding EH\nIoT devices. RAB uses a properly designed CSI-free beamformer combined with a\ncontinuous or periodic rotation of the ULA at the PB to provide average EH\ngains that scale as $0.85\\sqrt{M}$, where $M$ is the number of PB's antenna\nelements. Moreover, a rotation-specific power control mechanism was proposed to\ni) fairly optimize the WET process if devices' positioning information is\navailable, and/or ii) to avoid hazards to human health in terms of specific\nabsorption rate (SAR). We show that RAB performance even approaches quickly (or\nsurpasses, for scenarios with sufficiently large number of EH devices, or when\nusing the proposed power control) the performance of a traditional full-CSI\nbased transmit scheme, and it is also less sensitive to SAR constraints.\nFinally, we discuss important practicalities related to RAB such as its\nrobustness against non line-of-sight conditions compared to other CSI-free WET\nschemes, and its generalizability to scenarios where the PB uses other than a\nULA topology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Apr 2021 13:16:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["L\u00f3pez", "Onel L.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nactive set selection strategy to accelerate the CD algorithm and propose an\nefficient active set CD algorithm for solving the considered problem.\nSpecifically, at each iteration, the proposed active set CD algorithm first\nselects a small subset of all devices, namely the active set, which contains a\nfew devices that contribute the most to the deviation from the first-order\noptimality condition of the MLE problem thus potentially can provide the most\nimprovement to the objective function, then applies the CD algorithm to perform\nthe detection for the devices in the active set.

By using information\ntheory we study different properties associated with this communication model\nto show that the growth of GBM in a particular direction (node to stem) is\nrelated to an increase in mutual information. We further show that information\nflow between glioblastoma cells for different levels of invasiveness vary at\ndifferent points between node and stem. These findings are expected to\ncontribute significantly in the design of future therapeutic mechanisms for\nGBM.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Apr 2021 12:41:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-03", "authors_parsed": [["Awan", "Hamdan", ""], ["Odysseos", "Andreani", ""], ["Nicolaou", "Niovi", ""], ["Balasubramaniam", "Sasitharan", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.14985", "submitter": "Ruiqi Liu", "authors": "Ruiqi Liu, Qingqing Wu, Marco Di Renzo, Yifei Yuan", "title": "A Path to Smart Radio Environments: An Industrial Viewpoint on\n  Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces", "comments": "Submitted to IEEE Wireless Communications on April 27, 2021.

Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), sometimes referred to as\nintelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), have been identified to be potential\ncomponents of the future wireless networks because they can reconfigure the\npropagation environment for wireless signals with low-cost passive devices. In\ndoing so, the coverage of a cell can be expected to increase significantly as\nwell as the overall throughput of the network. RIS has not only become an\nattractive research area but also triggered a couple of projects to develop\nappropriate solutions to enable the set-up of hardware demonstrations and\nprototypes. In parallel, technical discussions and activities towards\nstandardization already took off in some regions. Promoting RIS to be\nintegrated into future commercial networks and become a commercial success\nrequires significant standardization work taken place both at regional level\nstandards developing organizations (SDO) and international SDOs such as the 3rd\nGeneration Partnership Project (3GPP). While many research papers study how RIS\ncan be used and optimized, few effort is devoted to analyzing the challenges to\ncommercialize RIS and how RIS can be standardized. This paper intends to shed\nsome light on RIS from an industrial viewpoint and provide a clear roadmap to\nmake RIS industrially feasible.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Apr 2021 13:21:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 29 Jul 2021 15:09:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Ruiqi", ""], ["Wu", "Qingqing", ""], ["Di Renzo", "Marco", ""], ["Yuan", "Yifei", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.15027", "submitter": "Lorenzo Miretti", "authors": "Lorenzo Miretti, Emil Bj\\\"ornson, David Gesbert", "title": "Team MMSE Precoding with Applications to Cell-free Massive MIMO", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  This article studies a novel distributed precoding design, coined team\nminimum mean-square error (TMMSE) precoding, which rigorously generalizes\nclassical centralized MMSE precoding to distributed operations based on\ntransmitter-specific channel state information (CSIT). Building on the\nso-called theory of teams, we derive a set of necessary and sufficient\nconditions for optimal TMMSE precoding, in the form of an infinite dimensional\nlinear system of equations. These optimality conditions are further specialized\nto cell-free massive MIMO networks, and explicitly solved for two important\nexamples, i.e., the classical case of local CSIT and the case of unidirectional\nCSIT sharing along a serial fronthaul. The latter case is relevant, e.g., for\nthe recently proposed radio stripe concept and the related advances on\nsequential processing exploiting serial connections. In both cases, our optimal\ndesign outperforms the heuristic methods that are known from the previous\nliterature. Duality arguments and numerical simulations validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed team theoretical approach in terms of ergodic\nachievable rates under a sum-power constraint.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Apr 2021 14:27:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-03", "authors_parsed": [["Miretti", "Lorenzo", ""], ["Bj\u00f6rnson", "Emil", ""], ["Gesbert", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.15079", "submitter": "Aldo Glielmo Mr.", "authors": "Aldo Glielmo, Claudio Zeni, Bingqing Cheng, Gabor Csanyi, Alessandro\n  Laio", "title": "Ranking the information content of distance measures", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ML cs.IT cs.LG math.IT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Real-world data typically contain a large number of features that are often\nheterogeneous in nature, relevance, and also units of measure.
