CS theory enables exact reconstruction\nof a sparse signal from relatively few linear measurements via a suitable\nnonlinear minimization process. Conventional CS theory relies on vectorial data\nrepresentation, which results in good compression ratios at the expense of\nincreased computational complexity. In applications involving color images,\nvideo sequences, and multi-sensor networks, the data is intrinsically of\nhigh-order, and thus more suitably represented in tensorial form. Standard\napplications of CS to higher-order data typically involve representation of the\ndata as long vectors that are in turn measured using large sampling matrices,\nthus imposing a huge computational and memory burden. In this chapter, we\nintroduce Generalized Tensor Compressed Sensing (GTCS)--a unified framework for\ncompressed sensing of higher-order tensors which preserves the intrinsic\nstructure of tensorial data with reduced computational complexity at\nreconstruction. We demonstrate that GTCS offers an efficient means for\nrepresentation of multidimensional data by providing simultaneous acquisition\nand compression from all tensor modes.

However, the spatial variation of the energy field\ncan lead to fluctuations in power supplied to the network and thereby affects\nits coverage. This warrants research on quantifying the aforementioned negative\neffect and countermeasure techniques, motivating the current work. First, a\nnovel energy field model is presented, in which fixed maximum energy intensity\n$\\gamma$ occurs at Poisson distributed locations, called energy centers. The\nintensities fall off from the centers following an exponential decay function\nof squared distance and the energy intensity at an arbitrary location is given\nby the decayed intensity from the nearest energy center. The product between\nthe energy center density and the exponential rate of the decay function,\ndenoted as $\\psi$, is shown to determine the energy field distribution. Next,\nthe paper considers a cellular downlink network powered by harvesting energy\nfrom the energy field and analyzes its network coverage. For the case of\nharvesters deployed at the same sites as base stations (BSs), as $\\gamma$\nincreases, the mobile outage probability is shown to scale as $(c\n\\gamma^{-\\pi\\psi}+p)$, where $p$ is the outage probability corresponding to a\nflat energy field and $c$ a constant. Subsequently, a simple scheme is proposed\nfor counteracting the energy randomness by spatial averaging. Specifically,\ndistributed harvesters are deployed in clusters and the generated energy from\nthe same cluster is aggregated and then redistributed to BSs. As the cluster\nsize increases, the power supplied to each BS is shown to converge to a\nconstant proportional to the number of harvesters per BS.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Apr 2014 10:13:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Sep 2014 05:22:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 28 Mar 2015 09:08:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Kaibin", ""], ["Kountouris", "Marios", ""], ["Li", "Victor O.

Wireless\nbackhaul is an attractive option for small cells as it provides a less\nexpensive and easy-to-deploy alternative to fiber.

After recasting the non-separable\nnuclear norm into a form amenable to online optimization, real-time algorithms\nwith complementary strengths are developed and their convergence is established\nunder simplifying technical assumptions. In a stationary setting, the\nasymptotic estimates obtained offer the well-documented performance guarantees\nof the {\\em batch} nuclear-norm regularized estimator. Under the same unifying\nframework, a novel online (adaptive) algorithm is developed to obtain multi-way\ndecompositions of \\emph{low-rank tensors} with missing entries, and perform\nimputation as a byproduct. Simulated tests with both synthetic as well as real\nInternet and cardiac magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) data confirm the efficacy\nof the proposed algorithms, and their superior performance relative to\nstate-of-the-art alternatives.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 17 Apr 2014 22:55:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Mardani", "Morteza", ""], ["Mateos", "Gonzalo", ""], ["Giannakis", "Georgios B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.4711", "submitter": "Luca Sanguinetti", "authors": "Marco Moretti and Luca Sanguinetti and Xiaodong Wang", "title": "Resource Allocation for Power Minimization in the Downlink of THP-based\n  Spatial Multiplexing MIMO-OFDMA Systems", "comments": "12 pages, 6 figures, IEEE Trans.

This reliance on directional\nbeamforming, however, complicates initial cell search since the mobile and base\nstation must jointly search over a potentially large angular directional space\nto locate a suitable path to initiate communication. To address this problem,\nthis paper proposes a directional cell discovery procedure where base stations\nperiodically transmit synchronization signals, potentially in time-varying\nrandom directions, to scan the angular space.

Compressed sensing (CS) is a promising\nframework to address it, due to its energy-efficient data compression\nprocedure. However, most CS algorithms have difficulty in data recovery due to\nnon-sparsity characteristic of many physiological signals. Block sparse\nBayesian learning (BSBL) is an effective approach to recover such signals with\nsatisfactory recovery quality. However, it is time-consuming in recovering\nmultichannel signals, since its computational load almost linearly increases\nwith the number of channels.\n  This work proposes a spatiotemporal sparse Bayesian learning algorithm to\nrecover multichannel signals simultaneously. It not only exploits temporal\ncorrelation within each channel signal, but also exploits inter-channel\ncorrelation among different channel signals. Furthermore, its computational\nload is not significantly affected by the number of channels. The proposed\nalgorithm was applied to brain computer interface (BCI) and EEG-based driver's\ndrowsiness estimation. Results showed that the algorithm had both better\nrecovery performance and much higher speed than BSBL.

In this\nwork, we consider a system with non-uniform popularity content which is divided\ninto multiple levels, based on varying degrees of popularity. The main\ncontribution of this work is the derivation of an order-optimal scheme which\njudiciously shares cache memory among files with different popularities. To\nshow order-optimality we derive new information-theoretic lower bounds, which\nuse a sliding-window entropy inequality, effectively creating a non-cutset\nbound. We also extend the ideas to when users can access multiple caches along\nwith the broadcast. Finally we consider two extreme cases of user distribution\nacross caches for the multi-level popularity model: a single user per cache\n(single-user setup) versus a large number of users per cache (multi-user\nsetup), and demonstrate a dichotomy in the order-optimal strategies for these\ntwo extreme cases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Apr 2014 21:32:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 31 Dec 2015 20:51:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Hachem", "Jad", ""], ["Karamchandani", "Nikhil", ""], ["Diggavi", "Suhas", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.6585", "submitter": "Eric Graves", "authors": "Eric Graves and Tan F.

The model can be depicted as a multiple-server queue with\narrivals of data retrieving requests and a server corresponding to a thread.\nHowever, this is not a typical queueing model because a server can terminate\nits operation, depending on when other servers complete their service (due to\nthe redundancy that is spread across the threads). Hence, to the best of our\nknowledge, the analysis of this queueing model remains quite uncharted.\n  Recent traces from Amazon S3 show that the time to retrieve a fixed size\nchunk is random and can be approximated as a constant delay plus an i.i.d.\nexponentially distributed random variable. For the tractability of the\ntheoretical analysis, we assume that the chunk downloading time is i.i.d.\nexponentially distributed. Under this assumption, we show that any\nwork-conserving scheme is delay-optimal among all on-line scheduling schemes\nwhen k = 1.

D2D enables efficient reuse\nof the licensed spectrum to support localized transmissions, while M2M\nconnections are often characterized by fixed and low transmission rates. D2D\nconnections can be instrumental in localized aggregation of uplink M2M traffic\nto a more capable cellular device, before being finally delivered to the Base\nStation (BS). In this paper we show that a fixed M2M rate is an enabler of\nefficient Machine-Type D2D underlay operation taking place simultaneously with\nanother \\emph{downlink} cellular transmission. In the considered scenario, a BS\n$B$ transmits to a user $U$, while there are $N_M$ Machine-Type Devices (MTDs)\nattached to $U$, all sending simultaneously to $U$ and each using the same rate\n$R_M$. While assuming that $B$ knows the channel $B-U$, but not the interfering\nchannels from the MTDs to $U$, we prove that there is a positive downlink rate\nthat can always be decoded by $U$, leading to zero-outage of the downlink\nsignal. This is a rather surprising consequence of the features of the multiple\naccess channel and the fixed rate $R_M$. We also consider the case of a\nsimpler, single-user decoder at $U$ with successive interference cancellation.\nHowever, with single-user decoder, a positive zero-outage rate exists only when\n$N_M=1$ and is zero when $N_M>1$.

For a broad class of random projections, including those\nbased on various sub-Gaussian distributions as well as randomized Hadamard and\nFourier transforms, the data matrix defining the cost function can be projected\ndown to the statistical dimension of the tangent cone of the constraints at the\noriginal solution, which is often substantially smaller than the original\ndimension.

In this paper, we determine the entire s.d.o.f. regions of these\ntwo channel models. The converse for the MAC follows from a middle step in the\nconverse of [1,2]. The converse for the IC includes constraints both due to\nsecrecy as well as due to interference. Although the portion of the region\nclose to the optimum sum s.d.o.f. point is governed by the upper bounds due to\nsecrecy constraints, the other portions of the region are governed by the upper\nbounds due to interference constraints. Different from the existing literature,\nin order to fully understand the characterization of the s.d.o.f. region of the\nIC, one has to study the 4-user case, i.e., the 2 or 3-user cases do not\nillustrate the generality of the problem. In order to prove the achievability,\nwe use the polytope structure of the converse region. In both MAC and IC cases,\nwe develop explicit schemes that achieve the extreme points of the polytope\nregion given by the converse. Specifically, the extreme points of the MAC\nregion are achieved by an m-user MAC wiretap channel with (K-m) helpers, i.e.,\nby setting (K-m) users' secure rates to zero and utilizing them as pure\n(structured) cooperative jammers. The extreme points of the IC region are\nachieved by a (K-m)-user IC with confidential messages, m helpers, and N\nexternal eavesdroppers, for m>=1 and a finite N. A byproduct of our results in\nthis paper is that the sum s.d.o.f. is achieved only at one extreme point of\nthe s.d.o.f. region, which is the symmetric-rate extreme point, for both MAC\nand IC channel models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Apr 2014 19:45:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Xie", "Jianwei", ""], ["Ulukus", "Sennur", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.7586", "submitter": "Feng Jiang", "authors": "Feng Jiang and Jie Chen and A.

This paper highlights the implementation of OFDM in\nDigital Video Broadcasting-Terrestrial (DVB-T). It mainly focuses on the timing\noffset problem present in OFDM systems and its proposed solution using Cyclic\nPrefix (CP) as a modified SC (Schmidl and COX) algorithm. It also highlights\nthe timing synchronization as well as performance comparison through bit error\nrate. Synchronization issues in OFDM are important and can lead to information\nloss if not properly addressed. Simulations were performed to implement DVB-T\nsystem and to compare different synchronization methods under certain\ndistribution model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Apr 2014 19:29:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Farhan", "Farhan", ""]]}]
