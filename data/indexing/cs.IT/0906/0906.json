Using free probability theory\nand assuming that the noise power at relaying levels-- but not at destination--\nis negligible, the closed-form expression of the asymptotic instantaneous\nend-to-end mutual information is derived as the number of antennas at all\nlevels grows large. The so-obtained deterministic expression is independent\nfrom the channel realizations while depending only on channel statistics.\nMoreover, it also serves as the asymptotic value of the average end-to-end\nmutual information. The optimal singular vectors of the precoding matrices that\nmaximize the average mutual information with finite number of antennas at all\nlevels are also provided. It turns out that the optimal precoding singular\nvectors are aligned to the eigenvectors of the channel correlation matrices.\nThus they can be determined using only the known channel statistics.

First we propose a deterministic channel model which captures the key\nwireless properties of signal strength, broadcast and superposition. We obtain\nan exact characterization of the capacity of a network with nodes connected by\nsuch deterministic channels. This result is a natural generalization of the\ncelebrated max-flow min-cut theorem for wired networks. Second, we use the\ninsights obtained from the deterministic analysis to design a new\nquantize-map-and-forward scheme for Gaussian networks. In this scheme, each\nrelay quantizes the received signal at the noise level and maps it to a random\nGaussian codeword for forwarding, and the final destination decodes the\nsource's message based on the received signal. We show that, in contrast to\nexisting schemes, this scheme can achieve the cut-set upper bound to within a\ngap which is independent of the channel parameters. In the case of the relay\nchannel with a single relay as well as the two-relay Gaussian diamond network,\nthe gap is 1 bit/s/Hz. Moreover, the scheme is universal in the sense that the\nrelays need no knowledge of the values of the channel parameters to\n(approximately) achieve the rate supportable by the network.
