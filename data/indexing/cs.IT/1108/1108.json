Two users\ncommunicate with one destination over a discrete memoryless channel using time\ndivision. Each transmission block is divided into 3 time slots with variable\ndurations: the destination is always in receive mode, while each user\nalternatively transmits and receives during the first 2 time slots, then both\ncooperate to send information during the last one. The paper proposes two\ndecode-forward based coding schemes, analyzes their rate regions, and also\nderives two outer bounds with rate constraints similar to the achievable\nregions. Both schemes requires no block Makovity, allowing the destination to\ndecode at the end of each block without any delay. In the first scheme, the\ncodewords in the third time slot are superimposed on the codewords of the first\ntwo, whereas in the second scheme, these codewords are independent. While the\nsecond scheme is simpler, the first scheme helps emphasize the importance of\njoint decoding over separate decoding among multiple time slots at the\ndestination. For the Gaussian channel, the two schemes with joint decoding are\nequivalent, as are the two outer bounds. For physically degraded Gaussian\nchannels, the proposed schemes achieve the capacity. Extension to the m-user\nhalf-duplex MAC-GF are provided. Numerical results for the Gaussian channel\nshows significant rate region improvement over the classical MAC and that the\nouter bound becomes increasingly tight as the inter-user link quality increases\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jul 2011 21:56:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Haija", "Ahmad Abu Al", ""], ["Vu", "Mai", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.0065", "submitter": "Michael Chertkov", "authors": "M.

Building on the compute-and-forward (C&F)\nrelaying strategy of Nazer and Gastpar, who demonstrated its asymptotic gain\nusing information-theoretic tools, an algebraic approach is taken to show its\npotential in practical, non-asymptotic, settings. A general framework is\ndeveloped for studying nested-lattice-based PNC schemes---called lattice\nnetwork coding (LNC) schemes for short---by making a direct connection between\nC&F and module theory. In particular, a generic LNC scheme is presented that\nmakes no assumptions on the underlying nested lattice code. C&F is\nre-interpreted in this framework, and several generalized constructions of LNC\nschemes are given. The generic LNC scheme naturally leads to a linear network\ncoding channel over modules, based on which non-coherent network coding can be\nachieved. Next, performance/complexity tradeoffs of LNC schemes are studied,\nwith a particular focus on hypercube-shaped LNC schemes. The error probability\nof this class of LNC schemes is largely determined by the minimum inter-coset\ndistances of the underlying nested lattice code. Several illustrative\nhypercube-shaped LNC schemes are designed based on Construction A and D,\nshowing that nominal coding gains of 3 to 7.5 dB can be obtained with\nreasonable decoding complexity.

So\nfar, the standard approach of distributed cross-layer design is based on dual\ndecomposition and the subgradient algorithm, which is a first-order method that\nhas a slow convergence rate. In this paper, we focus on solving a joint\nmulti-path routing and flow control (MRFC) problem by designing a new\ndistributed Newton's method, which is a second-order method and enjoys a\nquadratic rate of convergence. The major challenges in developing a distributed\nNewton's method lie in decentralizing the computation of the Hessian matrix and\nits inverse for both the primal Newton direction and dual variable updates. By\nappropriately reformulating, rearranging, and exploiting the special problem\nstructures, we show that it is possible to decompose such computations into\nsource nodes and links in the network, thus eliminating the need for global\ninformation. Furthermore, we derive closed-form expressions for both the primal\nNewton direction and dual variable updates, thus significantly reducing the\ncomputational complexity. The most attractive feature of our proposed\ndistributed Newton's method is that it requires almost the same scale of\ninformation exchange as in first-order methods, while achieving a quadratic\nrate of convergence as in centralized Newton methods. We provide extensive\nnumerical results to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm.

All the known low ML decoding complexity techniques utilize the\nsame approach of exploiting either the multigroup decodable or the\nfast-decodable (conditionally multigroup decodable) structure of a code. We\nrefer to this well known technique of decoding STBCs as Conditional ML (CML)\ndecoding. In this paper we introduce a new framework to construct ML decoders\nfor STBCs based on the Generalized Distributive Law (GDL) and the Factor-graph\nbased Sum-Product Algorithm. We say that an STBC is fast GDL decodable if the\norder of GDL decoding complexity of the code is strictly less than M^l, where l\nis the number of independent symbols in the STBC, and M is the constellation\nsize. We give sufficient conditions for an STBC to admit fast GDL decoding, and\nshow that both multigroup and conditionally multigroup decodable codes are fast\nGDL decodable. For any STBC, whether fast GDL decodable or not, we show that\nthe GDL decoding complexity is strictly less than the CML decoding complexity.\nFor instance, for any STBC obtained from Cyclic Division Algebras which is not\nmultigroup or conditionally multigroup decodable, the GDL decoder provides\nabout 12 times reduction in complexity compared to the CML decoder. Similarly,\nfor the Golden code, which is conditionally multigroup decodable, the GDL\ndecoder is only half as complex as the CML decoder.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 14 Aug 2011 10:52:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 6 Jan 2012 05:19:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 25 Jan 2012 18:11:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 20 Apr 2012 09:50:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Natarajan", "Lakshmi Prasad", ""], ["Rajan", "B.

This asymptotic DMDT shows that the\nperformance of an N node network is limited by the weakest three-node\nsub-network, and the performance of a three-node sub-network is determined by\nits weakest link, and, hence, the optimal ARQ protocol needs to equalize the\nperformance on each link by allocating ARQ window sizes optimally. This\nequalization is captured through a novel Variable Block-Length (VBL) ARQ\nprotocol that we propose, which achieves the optimal DMDT.\n  We then consider the DMDT in the finite SNR regime, where the delay is caused\nby both the ARQ retransmissions and queueing. We characterize the finite SNR\nDMDT of the fixed ARQ protocol, when an end-to-end delay constraint is imposed,\nby deriving the probability of message error using an approach that couples the\ninformation outage analysis with the queueing network analysis. The exponent of\nthe probability of deadline violation demonstrates that the system performance\nis again limited by the weakest three-node sub-network.

Recent work by\nAvestimehr et al. has approximated the capacity of this network up to an\nadditive gap. The communication scheme achieving this capacity approximation is\nbased on compress-and-forward, resulting in noise accumulation as the messages\ntraverse the network. As a consequence, the approximation gap increases\nlinearly with the network depth.\n  This paper develops a computation alignment strategy that can approach the\ncapacity of a class of layered, time-varying wireless relay networks up to an\napproximation gap that is independent of the network depth. This strategy is\nbased on the compute-and-forward framework, which enables relays to decode\ndeterministic functions of the transmitted messages. Alone, compute-and-forward\nis insufficient to approach the capacity as it incurs a penalty for\napproximating the wireless channel with complex-valued coefficients by a\nchannel with integer coefficients. Here, this penalty is circumvented by\ncarefully matching channel realizations across time slots to create\ninteger-valued effective channels that are well-suited to compute-and-forward.\nUnlike prior constant gap results, the approximation gap obtained in this paper\nalso depends closely on the fading statistics, which are assumed to be i.i.d.\nRayleigh.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Aug 2011 18:26:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 25 Oct 2012 21:49:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 4 Feb 2013 14:21:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Niesen", "Urs", ""], ["Nazer", "Bobak", ""], ["Whiting", "Phil", ""]]}]
