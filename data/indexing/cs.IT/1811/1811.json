The goal of this paper is thus to analyze fundamental properties of\nscaled R\\'enyi information from a noncommutative measure-theoretic perspective.\nFirstly, we prove the uniform equicontinuity for all three quantum versions of\nR\\'enyi information, hence it yields the joint continuity of these quantities\nin the orders and priors. Secondly, we establish the concavity in the region of\n$s\\in(-1,0)$ for both Petz's and the sandwiched versions. This completes the\nopen questions raised by Holevo\n[\\href{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/868501/}{\\textit{IEEE\nTrans.~Inf.~Theory}, \\textbf{46}(6):2256--2261, 2000}], Mosonyi and Ogawa\n[\\href{https://doi.org/10.1007/s00220-017-2928-4/}{\\textit{Commun.~Math.~Phys},\n\\textbf{355}(1):373--426, 2017}]. For the applications, we show that the strong\nconverse exponent in classical-quantum channel coding satisfies a minimax\nidentity. The established concavity is further employed to prove an entropic\nduality between classical data compression with quantum side information and\nclassical-quantum channel coding, and a Fenchel duality in joint source-channel\ncoding with quantum side information in the forthcoming papers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 10 Nov 2018 09:07:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Cheng", "Hao-Chung", ""], ["Li", "Gao", ""], ["Hsieh", "Min-Hsiu", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.04251", "submitter": "David  McAllester", "authors": "David McAllester and Karl Stratos", "title": "Formal Limitations on the Measurement of Mutual Information", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.LG math.IT stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Measuring mutual information from finite data is difficult.

This work develops an $\\tilde{O}(n d^2+n^2)$-time algorithm which\nperfectly recovers the true vertex correspondence with high probability,\nprovided that the average degree is at least $d = \\Omega(\\log^2 n)$ and the two\ngraphs differ by at most $\\delta = O( \\log^{-2}(n) )$ fraction of edges. For\ndense graphs and sparse graphs, this can be improved to $\\delta = O(\n\\log^{-2/3}(n) )$ and $\\delta = O( \\log^{-2}(d) )$ respectively, both in\npolynomial time. The methodology is based on appropriately chosen distance\nstatistics of the degree profiles (empirical distribution of the degrees of\nneighbors).

This leaves us with a substantial\nknowledge gap which is often perceived as a lack of practical intuition\nregarding probabilistic and statistical concepts.\n  Take for instance the R\\'enyi divergence which is a well-known statistical\nquantity specifically designed as a measure of disagreement between\nprobabilistic models. Despite its widespread use in science and engineering,\nthe R\\'enyi divergence remains a highly abstract axiomatically-motivated\nmeasure.

The expected financial performance\nof such investments quantifies the amount of disagreement in a tangible way.\nThis provides intuition for statistical concepts such as the R\\'enyi divergence\nwhich becomes connected to the financial performance of optimized investments.\nInvestment optimization takes into account individual opinions as well as\nattitudes towards risk. The result is a market-like social mechanism by which\nfunds flow naturally to support a more accurate view.

In particular, in the opposite case of compressing the quantum part\nof the source, using the classical part as side information at the decoder,\ntypically the rate sum is strictly larger than the von Neumann entropy of the\ntotal source.\n  We determine the full rate region in the generic case, showing that, apart\nfrom the Devetak-Winter point, all other points in the achievable region have a\nrate sum strictly larger than the joint entropy.

First, we propose a novel coded matrix\nmultiplication technique called Generalized PolyDot codes that advances on\nexisting methods for coded matrix multiplication under storage and\ncommunication constraints. This technique uses \"garbage alignment,\" i.e.,\naligning computations in coded computing that are not a part of the desired\noutput. Generalized PolyDot codes bridge between Polynomial codes and MatDot\ncodes, trading off between recovery threshold and communication costs. Second,\nwe demonstrate that Generalized PolyDot can be used for training large Deep\nNeural Networks (DNNs) on unreliable nodes prone to soft-errors. This requires\nus to address three additional challenges: (i) prohibitively large overhead of\ncoding the weight matrices in each layer of the DNN at each iteration; (ii)\nnonlinear operations during training, which are incompatible with linear\ncoding; and (iii) not assuming presence of an error-free master node, requiring\nus to architect a fully decentralized implementation without any \"single point\nof failure.\" We allow all primary DNN training steps, namely, matrix\nmultiplication, nonlinear activation, Hadamard product, and update steps as\nwell as the encoding/decoding to be error-prone. We consider the case of\nmini-batch size $B=1$, as well as $B>1$, leveraging coded matrix-vector\nproducts, and matrix-matrix products respectively. The problem of DNN training\nunder soft-errors also motivates an interesting, probabilistic error model\nunder which a real number $(P,Q)$ MDS code is shown to correct $P-Q-1$ errors\nwith probability $1$ as compared to $\\lfloor \\frac{P-Q}{2} \\rfloor$ for the\nmore conventional, adversarial error model. We also demonstrate that our\nproposed strategy can provide unbounded gains in error tolerance over a\ncompeting replication strategy and a preliminary MDS-code-based strategy for\nboth these error models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Nov 2018 00:06:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-28", "authors_parsed": [["Dutta", "Sanghamitra", ""], ["Bai", "Ziqian", ""], ["Jeong", "Haewon", ""], ["Low", "Tze Meng", ""], ["Grover", "Pulkit", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.10783", "submitter": "Masahiro Kaminaga", "authors": "Toshinori Suzuki, Masahiro Kaminaga", "title": "A True Random Number Generator Method Embedded in Wireless Communication\n  Systems", "comments": "We decided to withdraw this paper in order to significantly rewrite\n  this paper", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.CR math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  To increase the number of wireless devices, e.g., mobile or IoT terminals,\ncryptosystems are essential for secure communications.

Moreover, BiLMS exhibits a very good mean square error (MSE)\nperformance as compared to both LMS and EKF, which makes it a promising channel\ntracking algorithm for a mobile mmWave transmission scenario. We also show that\nLMS and BiLMS algorithms are more robust against the impairments due to the\nnon-optimal antenna array size as compared to EKF, and show relatively faster\nconvergence characteristic along with increasing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Nov 2018 03:55:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 20 Dec 2018 15:10:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-21", "authors_parsed": [["Yapici", "Yavuz", ""], ["Guvenc", "Ismail", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.11971", "submitter": "Shujian Yu", "authors": "Shujian Yu and Jose C.

Based on these strategies, the age-of-information (AoI) metric and the\ncompletion time are characterized. A convex combination of the two metrics is\noptimized over the scheduling parameters. The problem is shown to be convex and\nthus can be solved optimally. Moreover, based on the offline policy, an online\nalgorithm for job scheduling is developed. Numerical results demonstrate\nsignificant improvement as compared to the considered baselines.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Nov 2018 18:23:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Alabbasi", "Abubakr", ""], ["Aggarwal", "Vaneet", ""]]}]
