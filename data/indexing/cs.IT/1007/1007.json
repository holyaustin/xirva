Third, using lattice programming and\nstochastic dominance, sufficient conditions are given for the optimal decision\npolicy to consist of a single linear hyperplane, or, more generally, a\nthreshold curve. Estimation of the optimal linear approximation to this\nthreshold curve is formulated as a simulation-based stochastic optimization\nproblem. Finally, the paper shows that in multi-agent sensor management with\nquickest detection, where each agent views the world according to its prior,\nthe optimal policy has a similar structure to social learning.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 4 Jul 2010 17:06:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 30 Aug 2011 09:01:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 2 Mar 2012 18:55:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Krishnamurthy", "Vikram", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.0799", "submitter": "Kenta Kasai", "authors": "Kenta Kasai and Kohichi Sakaniwa", "title": "Fountain Codes with Multiplicatively Repeated Non-Binary LDPC Codes", "comments": "To appear in Proc. 6th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and\n  Iterative Information Processing", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study fountain codes transmitted over the binary-input symmetric-output\nchannel.

We\nuse the LP formulation proposed by Flanagan et al. as a basis and derive a pair\nof primal-dual LP formulations. The dual LP is then used to develop the\nlow-complexity LP decoding algorithm for nonbinary linear codes. In contrast to\nthe binary low-complexity LP decoding algorithm, our proposed algorithm is not\ndirectly related to the nonbinary SP algorithm. Nevertheless, the complexity of\nthe proposed algorithm is linear in the block length and is limited mainly by\nthe maximum check node degree. As a proof of concept, we also present a\nsimulation result for a $[80,48]$ LDPC code defined over $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ using\nquaternary phase-shift keying over the AWGN channel, and we show that the\nerror-correcting performance of the proposed LP decoding algorithm is similar\nto that of the standard LP decoding using the simplex solver.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Jul 2010 13:15:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 4 Oct 2010 16:25:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-05", "authors_parsed": [["Punekar", "Mayur", ""], ["Flanagan", "Mark F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.1407", "submitter": "Amir Ingber", "authors": "Amir Ingber and Meir Feder", "title": "Parallel Bit Interleaved Coded Modulation", "comments": "19 pages, 15 figures.

Reliability is measured in\nterms of Bob's probability of error in recovering the message, while security\nis measured in terms of the mutual information between the message and Eve's\nobservations. Wyner showed that the situation is characterized by a single\nconstant C_s, called the secrecy capacity, which has the following meaning: for\nall $\\epsilon > 0$, there exist coding schemes of rate $R \\ge C_s - \\epsilon$\nthat asymptotically achieve both the reliability and the security objectives.\nHowever, his proof of this result is based upon a nonconstructive random-coding\nargument. To date, despite a considerable research effort, the only case where\nwe know how to construct coding schemes that achieve secrecy capacity is when\nEve's channel C_2 is an erasure channel, or a combinatorial variation thereof.\n  Polar codes were recently invented by Arikan; they approach the capacity of\nsymmetric binary-input discrete memoryless channels with low encoding and\ndecoding complexity. Herein, we use polar codes to construct a coding scheme\nthat achieves the secrecy capacity of general wiretap channels. Our\nconstruction works for any instantiation of the wiretap channel model, as\noriginally defined by Wyner, as long as both C_1 and C_2 are symmetric and\nbinary-input. Moreover, we show how to modify our construction in order to\nachieve strong security, as defined by Maurer, while still operating at a rate\nthat approaches the secrecy capacity. In this case, we cannot guarantee that\nthe reliability condition will be satisfied unless the main channel C_1 is\nnoiseless, although we believe it can be always satisfied in practice.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Jul 2010 06:49:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 25 Sep 2011 04:01:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-05", "authors_parsed": [["Mahdavifar", "Hessam", ""], ["Vardy", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.3588", "submitter": "Jesus Martinez-Mateo", "authors": "Jesus Martinez-Mateo, David Elkouss, Vicente Martin", "title": "Improved construction of irregular progressive edge-growth Tanner graphs", "comments": "3 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": "Communications Letters, IEEE Volume: 14 , Issue: 12, Publication\n  Year: 2010 , Page(s): 1155 - 1157", "doi": "10.1109/LCOMM.2010.101810.101384", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The progressive edge-growth algorithm is a well-known procedure to construct\nregular and irregular low-density parity-check codes.

The core feature of the model, based on a discrete time Markov chain,\nis the consideration of different channel and subchannel allocation strategies\nunder different Primary and Secondary user types, traffic and priority levels.\nThe analytical model also assesses the impact of different spectrum sensing\nstrategies on the throughput of OS-OFDMA network. The analysis applies to the\nIEEE 802.22 standard, to evaluate the impact of two-stage spectrum sensing\nstrategy and varying temporal activity of wireless microphones on the IEEE\n802.22 throughput. Our study suggests that OS-OFDMA with subchannel notching\nand channel bonding could provide almost ten times higher throughput compared\nwith the design without those options, when the activity and density of\nwireless microphones is very high. Furthermore, we confirm that OS-OFDMA\nimplementation without subchannel notching, used in the IEEE 802.22, is able to\nsupport real-time and non-real-time quality of service classes, provided that\nwireless microphones temporal activity is moderate (with approximately one\nwireless microphone per 3,000 inhabitants with light urban population density\nand short duty cycles). Finally, two-stage spectrum sensing option improves\nOS-OFDMA throughput, provided that the length of spectrum sensing at every\nstage is optimized using our model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Jul 2010 22:25:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 24 Mar 2011 18:58:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 29 Aug 2012 08:32:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-30", "authors_parsed": [["Park", "Jihoon", ""], ["Pawe\u0142czak", "Przemys\u0142aw", ""], ["Gr\u00f8nsund", "P\u00e5l", ""], ["\u010cabri\u0107", "Danijela", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.5282", "submitter": "Laszlo Kish", "authors": "Laszlo B.

It is important to understand\nhow the performance gains associated with beamforming depend on the accuracy or\ncurrency of the Channel State Information. This paper quantifies performance\ndegradation caused by aging of CSI. It uses outage probability to measure the\ncurrency of CSI, and to discount the performance gains associated with ideal\nbeamforming.
