Our proposed scheme not only\nexploits the properties of content-centric communications and local caching at\nthe base stations (BSs), but also incorporates RSMA to better manage\ninterference in multigroup multicast transmission with statistical channel\nstate information (CSI) known at the central processor (CP) and the BSs.

Besides making the real-time requirements more stringent, this\nimmersion will bring the notions of time, simultaneity, presence, and causality\nto a new level of complexity. A growing body of research points out that\nlatency is insufficient to parameterize all real-time requirements.

We establish a general statistical framework of timing\nrequirements in wireless communication systems, which subsumes both latency and\nAoI. The framework is made by associating a timing component with the two basic\nstatistical operations, decision and estimation. We first use the framework to\npresent a representative sample of the existing works that deal with timing in\nwireless communication. Next, it is shown how the framework can be used with\ndifferent communication models of increasing complexity, starting from the\nbasic Shannon one-way communication model and arriving to communication models\nfor consensus, distributed learning, and inference.

Our\nanalysis shows that the fusion mechanism of using a scalar coefficient can be\noversimplified for practical scenarios, as the information confidence of an MOD\nis complex and usually space-varying due to the imperfection of sensor ability\nand the various impacts from surveillance environment. Consequently, severe\nfusion performance degradation can be observed when these scalar weights fail\nto reflect the actual situation. We make two contributions towards addressing\nthis problem.

To capture the impact of non-ideal wireless channels on AirFL, a\nclosed-form expression for the optimality gap (a.k.a. convergence upper bound)\nbetween the actual loss and the optimal loss is derived.

Recently, a breakthrough\nwas made in reducing the channel estimation overhead by revealing that the\nIRS-BS (base station) channels are common in the cascaded user-IRS-BS channels\nof all the users, and if the cascaded channel of one typical user is estimated,\nthe other users' cascaded channels can be estimated very quickly based on their\ncorrelation with the typical user's channel \\cite{b5}. One limitation of this\nstrategy, however, is the waste of user energy, because many users need to keep\nsilent when the typical user's channel is estimated. In this paper, we reveal\nanother correlation hidden in the cascaded user-IRS-BS channels by observing\nthat the user-IRS channel is common in all the cascaded channels from users to\neach BS antenna as well. Building upon this finding, we propose a novel\ntwo-phase channel estimation protocol in the uplink communication.\nSpecifically, in Phase I, the correlation coefficients between the channels of\na typical BS antenna and those of the other antennas are estimated; while in\nPhase II, the cascaded channel of the typical antenna is estimated. In\nparticular, all the users can transmit throughput Phase I and Phase II. Under\nthis strategy, it is theoretically shown that the minimum number of time\ninstants required for perfect channel estimation is the same as that of the\naforementioned strategy in the ideal case without BS noise.

More specifically, RISs are\ndeployed under the UAVs termed as UAVs-RISs that operate over the micro-wave\n($\\mu$W) channel in the sky to sustain a strong line-of-sight (LoS) connection\nwith the ground users. The macro-cell operates over the $\\mu$W channel based on\northogonal multiple access (OMA), while small base stations (SBSs) operate over\nthe millimeter-wave (mmW) channel based on non-orthogonal multiple access\n(NOMA). We study the problem of total transmit power minimization by jointly\noptimizing the trajectory/velocity of each UAV, RISs' phase shifts, subcarrier\nallocations, and active beamformers at each BS. The underlying problem is\nhighly non-convex and the global optimal solution is intractable. To handle it,\nwe decompose the original problem into two subproblems, i.e., a subproblem\nwhich deals with the UAVs' trajectories/velocities, RISs' phase shifts, and\nsubcarrier allocations for $\\mu$W; and a subproblem for active beamforming\ndesign and subcarrier allocation for mmW. In particular, we solve the first\nsubproblem via the dueling deep Q-Network (DQN) learning approach by developing\na distributed algorithm which leads to a better policy evaluation. Then, we\nsolve the active beamforming design and subcarrier allocation for the mmW via\nthe successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Simulation results exhibit\nthe effectiveness of the proposed resource allocation scheme compared to other\nbaseline schemes. In particular, it is revealed that by deploying UAVs-RISs,\nthe transmit power can be reduced by 6 dBm while maintaining similar guaranteed\nQoS.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Jun 2021 16:51:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-25", "authors_parsed": [["Khalili", "Ata", ""], ["Monfard", "Ehsan Mohammadi", ""], ["Zargari", "Shayan", ""], ["Javan", "Mohammad Reza.", ""], ["Mokari", "Nader", ""], ["Jorswieck", "Eduard A.", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.13341", "submitter": "Robert Graczyk", "authors": "Robert Graczyk, Amos Lapidoth, Neri Merhav, Christoph Pfister", "title": "Guessing Based on Compressed Side Information", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A source sequence is to be guessed with some fidelity based on a rate-limited\ndescription of an observed sequence with which it is correlated.

To address the two performance limitations, we consider in this\npaper an MEC-enabled IoT system with an energy harvesting (EH) wireless device\n(WD) which opportunistically accesses the licensed spectrum of an overlaid\nprimary communication link for task offloading. We aim to maximize the\nlong-term average sensing rate of the WD subject to quality of service (QoS)\nrequirement of primary link, average power constraint of MEC server (MS) and\ndata queue stability of both MS and WD. We formulate the problem as a\nmulti-stage stochastic optimization and propose an online algorithm named PLySE\nthat applies the perturbed Lyapunov optimization technique to decompose the\noriginal problem into per-slot deterministic optimization problems. For each\nper-slot problem, we derive the closed-form optimal solution of data sensing\nand processing control to facilitate low-complexity real-time implementation.\nInterestingly, our analysis finds that the optimal solution exhibits an\nthreshold-based structure. Simulation results collaborate with our analysis and\ndemonstrate more than 46.7\\% data sensing rate improvement of the proposed\nPLySE over representative benchmark methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 27 Jun 2021 00:16:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Xian", ""], ["Bi", "Suzhi", ""], ["Quan", "Zhi", ""], ["Wang", "Hui", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.14227", "submitter": "Xuewen Wu", "authors": "Xuewen Wu, Jingxiao Ma, Chenwei Gu, Xiaoping Xue, Xin Zeng", "title": "Robust Secure Transmission Design for IRS-Assisted mmWave Cognitive\n  Radio Networks", "comments": "15 pages, 13 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and millimeter wave (mmWave) communications\nare two major technologies to enhance the spectrum efficiency (SE).
