The infrastructure uses multi-antenna base stations (BSs), in which the\nnumber of BSs and the number of antennas at each BS can scale at arbitrary\nrates relative to $n$. Under the model, capacity scaling laws are analyzed for\nboth dense and extended networks. Two BS-based routing schemes are first\nintroduced in this study: an infrastructure-supported single-hop (ISH) routing\nprotocol with multiple-access uplink and broadcast downlink and an\ninfrastructure-supported multi-hop (IMH) routing protocol. Then, their\nachievable throughput scalings are analyzed. These schemes are compared against\ntwo conventional schemes without BSs: the multi-hop (MH) transmission and\nhierarchical cooperation (HC) schemes. It is shown that a linear throughput\nscaling is achieved in dense networks, as in the case without help of BSs. In\ncontrast, the proposed BS-based routing schemes can, under realistic network\nconditions, improve the throughput scaling significantly in extended networks.\nThe gain comes from the following advantages of these BS-based protocols.\nFirst, more nodes can transmit simultaneously in the proposed scheme than in\nthe MH scheme if the number of BSs and the number of antennas are large enough.\nSecond, by improving the long-distance signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the\nreceived signal power can be larger than that of the HC, enabling a better\nthroughput scaling under extended networks. Furthermore, by deriving the\ncorresponding information-theoretic cut-set upper bounds, it is shown under\nextended networks that a combination of four schemes IMH, ISH, MH, and HC is\norder-optimal in all operating regimes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Nov 2008 13:56:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 4 Apr 2010 04:36:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 6 Apr 2010 02:28:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Shin", "Won-Yong", ""], ["Jeon", "Sang-Woon", ""], ["Devroye", "Natasha", ""], ["Vu", "Mai H.", ""], ["Chung", "Sae-Young", ""], ["Lee", "Yong H.", ""], ["Tarokh", "Vahid", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.0731", "submitter": "Romain Couillet", "authors": "Romain Couillet, Merouane Debbah", "title": "Cognitive OFDM network sensing: a free probability approach", "comments": "12 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.AI math.IT math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, a practical power detection scheme for OFDM terminals, based\non recent free probability tools, is proposed.

Because each codeword conveys\nfour information symbols from an M-ary quadrature-amplitude modulation\nalphabet, the complexity of an exhaustive search decoder is proportional to\nM^2. In this paper we present a new fast algorithm for maximum-likelihood\ndecoding of the golden code that has a worst-case complexity of only O(2M^2.5).\nWe also present an efficient implementation of the fast decoder that exhibits a\nlow average complexity. Finally, in contrast to the overlaid Alamouti codes,\nwhich lose their fast decodability property on time-varying channels, we show\nthat the golden code is fast decodable on both quasistatic and rapid\ntime-varying channels.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Nov 2008 18:29:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-14", "authors_parsed": [["Sinnokrot", "Mohanned O.", ""], ["Barry", "John R.", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.2356", "submitter": "Shachar Lovett", "authors": "Tali Kaufman, Shachar Lovett", "title": "The List-Decoding Size of Reed-Muller Codes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.DM math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work we study the list-decoding size of Reed-Muller codes.
