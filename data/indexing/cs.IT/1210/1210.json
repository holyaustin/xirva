It applies to a large class of\nnoise distributions, and its proof is based on an extension of a result by\nGuionnet and Shlyakthenko [3] to the vector case in combination with the Ruzsa\ntriangle inequality for differential entropy introduced by Kontoyiannis and\nMadiman [4]. As in scalar ICs, achieving full DoF requires the use of singular\ninput distributions. Strikingly, in the vector case it suffices to enforce\nsingularity on the joint distribution of each individual transmit vector. This\ncan be realized through signaling in subspaces of the ambient signal space,\nwhich is in accordance with the idea of interference alignment, and, most\nimportantly, allows the scalar entries of the transmit vectors to have\nnon-singular distributions. The DoF-formula for vector ICs we obtain enables a\nunified treatment of \"classical\" interference alignment a la Cadambe and Jafar\n[5], and Maddah-Ali et al. [6], and the number-theoretic schemes proposed in\n[7], [8]. Moreover, it allows to calculate the DoF achieved by new signaling\nschemes for vector ICs. We furthermore recover the result by Cadambe and Jafar\non the non-separability of parallel ICs [9] and we show that almost all\nparallel ICs are separable in terms of DoF. Finally, our results apply to\ncomplex vector ICs, thereby extending the main findings of [2] to the complex\ncase.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Oct 2012 12:36:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 26 Sep 2014 13:37:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 7 Mar 2016 09:34:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 17 Jun 2016 08:14:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-20", "authors_parsed": [["Stotz", "David", ""], ["B\u00f6lcskei", "Helmut", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.2272", "submitter": "Reinhard Heckel", "authors": "Reinhard Heckel and Helmut B\\\"olcskei", "title": "Joint Sparsity with Different Measurement Matrices", "comments": "Allerton 2012", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a generalization of the multiple measurement vector (MMV)\nproblem, where the measurement matrices are allowed to differ across\nmeasurements.

While shaped\nAPSK can provide significant gains when used with standard off-the-shelf LDPC\ncodes, such as the codes in the DVB-S2 standard, additional non-negligible\ngains can be achieved by optimizing the LDPC code with respect to the shaped\nAPSK modulation.

FBP is an\niterative approach where each iteration consists of consecutive forward and\nbackward stages. The forward step first expands the support estimate by the\nforward step size, while the following backward step shrinks it by the backward\nstep size. The forward step size is larger than the backward step size, hence\nthe initially empty support estimate is expanded at the end of each iteration.\nForward and backward steps are iterated until the residual power of the\nobservation vector falls below a threshold. This structure of FBP does not\nnecessitate the sparsity level to be known a priori in contrast to the Subspace\nPursuit or Compressive Sampling Matching Pursuit algorithms.

Thirdly, the performance of\nFractional Sampling (FS) based SS is studied and a method for determining the\noperating point for the FS rate in terms of sensing performance and complexity\nis suggested. Finally, an SNR estimation technique based on the maximum\neigenvalue of the received signal's covariance matrix is proposed.

In such systems, a\ngroup of sensing nodes periodically collect measurements about the signals\nbeing observed in the given geographical region and transmit these measurements\nto a central node, which in turn processes this information to recover the\nsignals. For example, in cognitive radio networks, the signals of interest are\nthose generated by the primary transmitters and the sensing nodes are the\nsecondary users. In such networks, it is critically important to be able to\nreliably determine the presence or absence of primary transmitters in order to\navoid causing interference. The standard approach to transmit these\nmeasurements from sensor the nodes to the fusion center has been to use\northogonal channels. Such an approach quickly places a burden on the\ncontrol-channel-capacity of the network that would scale linearly in the number\nof cooperating sensing nodes. In this paper, we show that as long as one\ncondition is satisfied: the dynamics of the observed signals are sparse, i.e.,\nthe observed signals do not change their values very rapidly in relation to the\ntime-scale at which the measurements are collected, we can significantly reduce\nthe control bandwidth of the system while achieving the full (linear) bandwidth\nperformance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Oct 2012 01:45:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Ganapathy", "Harish", ""], ["Caramanis", "Constantine", ""], ["Ying", "Lei", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.7659", "submitter": "David Ellerman", "authors": "David Ellerman", "title": "The Objective Indefiniteness Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.IT math.IT math.LO physics.hist-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The common-sense view of reality is expressed logically in Boolean subset\nlogic (each element is either definitely in or not in a subset, i.e., either\ndefinitely has or does not have a property).

However, when sensors are\nrestricted to code their observations in small blocks (e.g., 1), intelligent\ncollaboration between sensors can greatly reduce distortion. For networks where\nsensors are allowed to \"chat\" using a side channel that is unobservable at the\nfusion center, we provide asymptotically-exact characterization of distortion\nperformance and optimal quantizer design in the high-resolution\n(low-distortion) regime using a framework called distributed functional scalar\nquantization (DFSQ). The key result is that chatting can dramatically improve\nperformance even when intersensor communication is at very low rate, especially\nif the fusion center desires fidelity of a nonlinear computation applied to\nsource realizations rather than fidelity in representing the sources\nthemselves. We also solve the rate allocation problem when communication links\nhave heterogeneous costs and provide a detailed example to demonstrate the\ntheoretical and practical gains from chatting. This example for maximum\ncomputation gives insight on the gap between chatting and distributed networks,\nand how to optimize the intersensor communication.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Oct 2012 17:15:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Sun", "John Z.", ""], ["Goyal", "Vivek K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.8441", "submitter": "Erdem Koyuncu", "authors": "Erdem Koyuncu and Hamid Jafarkhani", "title": "Very Low-Rate Variable-Length Channel Quantization for Minimum Outage\n  Probability", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We identify a practical vector quantizer design problem where any\nfixed-length quantizer (FLQ) yields non-zero distortion at any finite rate,\nwhile there is a variable-length quantizer (VLQ) that can achieve zero\ndistortion with arbitrarily low rate.
