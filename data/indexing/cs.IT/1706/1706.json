In the PIR problem with Byzantine\ndatabases (BPIR), a user wishes to retrieve a specific message from a set of\n$M$ messages with zero-error, irrespective of the actions performed by the\nByzantine databases. We consider the $T$-privacy constraint in this paper,\nwhere any $T$ databases can collude, and exchange the queries submitted by the\nuser.

The transmitter has to harvest radio\nfrequency (RF) energy from multiple PBs due to the shortage of embedded power\nsupply before establishing its secure communication. We consider two different\nscenarios. In the first, the PBs and the transmitter belong to the same\noperator, where we formulate the resource allocation problem as the\nminimization of the total transmit power subject to the target secure rate\nconstraint. The solution of this problem yields both the optimal power and\nenergy transfer time allocation. Due to the non-convexity of this problem, we\npropose a two-level approach, where the inner level problem can be recast as a\nconvex optimization framework via conic convex reformulation, while the outer\nlevel problem can be handled by using one-dimensional (1D) search. The second\nscenario considers the case where the transmitter and the PBs belong to\ndifferent service suppliers. Hence, we formulate the resource allocation\nproblem where we consider incentives for the PBs to assist the transmitter.\nThis leads to the formulation of a Stackelberg game for the secure\nwireless-powered multiantenna multicasting system. The transmitter has to pay\nfor the energy services from these multiple PBs in order to facilitate secure\ncommunications. In this game, the transmitter and the PB are modelled as leader\nand follower, respectively, in which both of them try to maximize their own\nutility function. The closed-form Stackelberg equilibrium of the formulated\ngame is then derived.

In addition, we\ninvestigate the performance of polar codes in the moderate deviations regime\nwhere both the gap to capacity and the error probability vanish as $n$ grows.\nAn explicit construction of polar codes is proposed to obey a certain tradeoff\nbetween the gap to capacity and the decay rate of the error probability for the\nAWGN channel.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Jun 2017 06:46:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-11", "authors_parsed": [["Fong", "Silas L.", ""], ["Tan", "Vincent Y.

Although its derivation is\nbased on a relaxed formulation of the RA problem, the algorithm is shown to\nconverge to integer-valued RA variables with probability 1 under mild\nassumptions on the distribution of user utilities. Simulations demonstrate\nimproved performance of the proposed algorithm compared to commonly considered\nheuristic RA procedures of comparable complexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 11 Jun 2017 09:31:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 16 Jun 2017 07:16:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Stefanatos", "Stelios", ""], ["Foukalas", "Fotis", ""], ["Tsiftsis", "Theodoros A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.03341", "submitter": "Quan-Lin Li", "authors": "Quan-Lin Li, Jing-Yu Ma, Mingzhou Xie and Li Xia", "title": "Group-Server Queues", "comments": "24 Pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PF cs.IT math.IT math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  By analyzing energy-efficient management of data centers, this paper proposes\nand develops a class of interesting {\\it Group-Server Queues}, and establishes\ntwo representative group-server queues through loss networks and impatient\ncustomers, respectively.

Moreover, we propose an adaptive error-controlled quantization\nencoder, which can further improve the prediction hitting rate considerably.\nThe data size can be reduced significantly after performing the variable-length\nencoding because of the uneven distribution produced by our quantization\nencoder. We evaluate the new compressor on production scientific data sets and\ncompare it with many other state-of-the-art compressors: GZIP, FPZIP, ZFP,\nSZ-1.1, and ISABELA. Experiments show that our compressor is the best in class,\nespecially with regard to compression factors (or bit-rates) and compression\nerrors (including RMSE, NRMSE, and PSNR). Our solution is better than the\nsecond-best solution by more than a 2x increase in the compression factor and\n3.8x reduction in the normalized root mean squared error on average, with\nreasonable error bounds and user-desired bit-rates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 12 Jun 2017 18:07:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-14", "authors_parsed": [["Tao", "Dingwen", ""], ["Di", "Sheng", ""], ["Chen", "Zizhong", ""], ["Cappello", "Franck", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.03833", "submitter": "Siamak Talebi", "authors": "Adel Ahmadi and Siamak Talebi", "title": "Fast Maximum-Likelihood Decoder for 4*4 Quasi-Orthogonal Space-Time\n  Block Code", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This letter introduces two fast maximum-likelihood (ML) detection methods for\n4*4 quasi-orthogonal space-time block code (QOSTBC).

We use the metric Age of Information (AoI), the time that has\nelapsed since the last received update was generated, to measure the\n\"freshness\" of the status information available at the destination. We assume\nenergy arrives randomly at the sensor according to a Poisson process, and each\nstatus update consumes one unit of energy. Our objective is to design optimal\nonline status update policies to minimize the long-term average AoI, subject to\nthe energy causality constraint at the sensor. We consider three scenarios,\ni.e., the battery size is infinite, finite, and one unit only, respectively.\n  For the infinite battery scenario, we adopt a best-effort uniform status\nupdate policy and show that it minimizes the long-term average AoI. For the\nfinite battery scenario, we adopt an energy-aware adaptive status update\npolicy, and prove that it is asymptotically optimal when the battery size goes\nto infinity. For the last scenario where the battery size is one, we first show\nthat within a broadly defined class of online policies, the optimal policy\nshould have a renewal structure, i.e., the status update epochs form a renewal\nprocess, and the length of each renewal interval depends on the first energy\narrival over that interval only. We then focus on a renewal interval, and prove\nthat if the AoI in the system is below a threshold when the first energy\narrives, the sensor should store the energy and hold status update until the\nAoI reaches the threshold, otherwise, it updates the status immediately. We\nanalytically characterize the long-term average AoI under such a\nthreshold-based policy, and explicitly identify the optimal threshold.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Jun 2017 03:50:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 20 Jun 2017 14:50:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 5 Jun 2018 19:36:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-07", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Xianwen", ""], ["Yang", "Jing", ""], ["Wu", "Jingxian", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.05813", "submitter": "Iran Ramezanipour", "authors": "Iran Ramezanipour, Pedro H.

Modern wireless communication networks are required to\naccommodate significantly varied types of mobile devices, differing in\navailable computational power or number of equipped antennas.

We define an information-theoretic metric, the delivery time per bit\n(DTB), that captures the worst-case per-bit delivery latency for conveying any\nrequested content to the users. For the cases when cloud and wireless\ntransmission occur either sequentially or in parallel, we establish coinciding\nlower and upper bounds on the DTB as a function of cache size, backhaul\ncapacity and wireless channel parameters. Through optimized rate allocation,\nour achievability scheme determines the best combination of private, common\nsignalling and interference neutralization that matches the converse. Our\nconverse bounds use subsets of wireless, fronthaul and caching resources of the\nF-RAN as side information that enable a single receiver to decode either one or\nboth users' requested files. We show the optimality on the DTB for all channel\nregimes. In case of serial transmission, the functional DTB-behavior changes at\nfronthaul capacity thresholds. In this context, we combine multiple channel\nregimes to classes of channel regimes which share the same fronthaul capacity\nthresholds and as such the same DTB-functional. In total, our analysis\nidentifies four classes; in only three of those edge caching and cloud\nprocessing can provide nontrivial synergestic and non-synergestic performance\ngains.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Jun 2017 10:11:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-26", "authors_parsed": [["Kakar", "Jaber", ""], ["Gherekhloo", "Soheil", ""], ["Sezgin", "Aydin", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.07631", "submitter": "Pinar Comak", "authors": "P{\\i}nar \\c{C}omak, Jon-Lark Kim and Ferruh \\\"Ozbudak", "title": "New cubic self-dual codes of length 54, 60 and 66", "comments": "8 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NT cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the construction of quasi-cyclic self-dual codes, especially of\nbinary cubic ones.

This allows for reconstruction of signals\nsupported in other domains (e.g., spatial) with no modification to the\nunderlying structure except for replacing the standard temporal delay with a\ngeneralized delay, that is, a practically realizable unitary transformation for\nwhich the basis elements are eigenfunctions.
