We consider a D2D pair in the presence of an MBS and a femto\naccess point, each serving a user, with quality of service constraints for all\nusers. Our proposed solution encompasses mode selection (choosing between\ncellular or reuse or dedicated mode), resource allocation (in cellular and\ndedicated mode) and power control (in reuse mode) within a single framework.\nThe framework prioritizes D2D dedicated mode if the D2D pair are close to each\nother and orthogonal resources are available. Otherwise, it allows D2D reuse\nmode if the D2D satisfies both the maximum distance and an additional\ninterference criteria. For reuse mode, we present a geometric vertex search\napproach to solve the power allocation problem. We analytically prove the\nvalidity of this approach and show that it achieves near optimal performance.\nFor cellular and dedicated modes, we show that frequency sharing maximizes sum\nrate and solve the resource allocation problem in closed form. Our simulations\ndemonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework in terms of the\nperformance gains achieved in D2D mode.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Sep 2015 02:38:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 20 Jan 2016 06:20:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 7 Apr 2016 05:02:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Yifei", ""], ["Nasir", "Ali A.", ""], ["Durrani", "Salman", ""], ["Zhou", "Xiangyun", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.00130", "submitter": "Yao Xie", "authors": "Ruiyang Song, Yao Xie, and Sebastian Pokutta", "title": "Sequential Information Guided Sensing", "comments": "Submitted for journal publication. arXiv admin note: substantial text\n  overlap with arXiv:1501.06241", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT math.ST stat.ML stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the value of information in sequential compressed sensing by\ncharacterizing the performance of sequential information guided sensing in\npractical scenarios when information is inaccurate.

First, satellite communications standards embed more than one user\nin each frame in order to increase the channel coding gain. This leads to the\ndifferent so-called multigroup multicast model, whose optimization requires\ncomputationally complex operations. Second, when the data traffic is generated\nby several Earth stations (gateways), the precoding matrix must be\ndistributively computed and attain additional payload restrictions. Third,\nsince the feedback channel is adverse (large delay and quantization errors),\nthe precoding must be able to deal with such uncertainties.

The considered MOOP takes into\naccount the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of all legitimate users for\nguaranteeing secure DL and UL transmission in the presence of potential\neavesdroppers. Thereby, secure UL transmission is enabled by the FD BS and\nwould not be possible with an HD BS. The imperfectness of the channel state\ninformation of the eavesdropping channels and the inter-user interference\nchannels is incorporated for robust resource allocation algorithm design.\nAlthough the considered MOOP is non-convex, we solve it optimally by\nsemidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. Simulation results not only unveil\nthe trade-off between the total DL transmit power and the total UL transmit\npower, but also confirm the robustness of the proposed algorithm against\npotential eavesdroppers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Sep 2015 12:27:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-07", "authors_parsed": [["Sun", "Yan", ""], ["Ng", "Derrick Wing Kwan", ""], ["Zhu", "Jun", ""], ["Schober", "Robert", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.01600", "submitter": "Seyed Alireza Razavi", "authors": "Alireza Razavi, Mikko Valkama, Elena-Simona Lohan", "title": "K-Means Fingerprint Clustering for Low-Complexity Floor Estimation in\n  Indoor Mobile Localization", "comments": "Accepted to IEEE Globecom 2015, Workshop on Localization and\n  Tracking: Indoors, Outdoors and Emerging Networks", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/GLOCOMW.2015.7414026", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Indoor localization in multi-floor buildings is an important research\nproblem. Finding the correct floor, in a fast and efficient manner, in a\nshopping mall or an unknown university building can save the users' search time\nand can enable a myriad of Location Based Services in the future. One of the\nmost widely spread techniques for floor estimation in multi-floor buildings is\nthe fingerprinting-based localization using Received Signal Strength (RSS)\nmeasurements coming from indoor networks, such as WLAN and BLE. The clear\nadvantage of RSS-based floor estimation is its ease of implementation on a\nmultitude of mobile devices at the Application Programming Interface (API)\nlevel, because RSS values are directly accessible through API interface.\nHowever, the downside of a fingerprinting approach, especially for large-scale\nfloor estimation and positioning solutions, is their need to store and transmit\na huge amount of fingerprinting data. The problem becomes more severe when the\nlocalization is intended to be done on mobile devices which have limited\nmemory, power, and computational resources. An alternative floor estimation\nmethod, which has lower complexity and is faster than the fingerprinting is the\nWeighted Centroid Localization (WCL) method. The trade-off is however paid in\nterms of a lower accuracy than the one obtained with traditional fingerprinting\nwith Nearest Neighbour (NN) estimates. In this paper a novel K-means-based\nmethod for floor estimation via fingerprint clustering of WiFi and various\nother positioning sensor outputs is introduced. Our method achieves a floor\nestimation accuracy close to the one with NN fingerprinting, while\nsignificantly improves the complexity and the speed of the floor detection\nalgorithm.

Our main contribution is a\nlow-complexity online algorithm to minimize the long-term average network\nservice cost, namely, the Lyapunov optimization-based BAPC (LBAPC) algorithm.\nOne main advantage of this algorithm is that the decisions depend only on the\ninstantaneous side information without requiring distribution information of\nchannels and EH processes. To determine the network operation, we only need to\nsolve a deterministic per-time slot problem, for which an efficient inner-outer\noptimization algorithm is proposed. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is shown\nto be asymptotically optimal via rigorous analysis. Finally, sample simulation\nresults are presented to verify the theoretical analysis as well as validate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Sep 2015 02:50:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 3 Oct 2015 05:44:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Mao", "Yuyi", ""], ["Zhang", "Jun", ""], ["Letaief", "Khaled B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.01931", "submitter": "Young-Han Kim", "authors": "Xianglan Jin, Young-Han Kim", "title": "The Approximate Capacity of the MIMO Relay Channel", "comments": "8 pages, 5 figures, submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Information\n  Theory", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/ISIT.2014.6875204", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Capacity bounds are studied for the multiple-antenna complex Gaussian relay\nchannel with t1 transmitting antennas at the sender, r2 receiving and t2\ntransmitting antennas at the relay, and r3 receiving antennas at the receiver.\nIt is shown that the partial decode-forward coding scheme achieves within\nmin(t1,r2) bits from the cutset bound and at least one half of the cutset\nbound, establishing a good approximate expression of the capacity.

Guided by energy efficiency concerns, we consider the\npartition of the whole network into clusters, each one with a coordination node\nor \\emph{cluster head}. Thus, the nodes transmit their measurements to the\ncorresponding cluster heads, which after some processing, communicate a summary\nof the received information to the fusion center, which takes the final\ndecision about the state of the nature. As the network has a fixed size,\ncommunication within smaller clusters will be less affected by the path loss\neffect, reducing energy consumption in the information exchange process between\nnodes and cluster heads. However, this limits the capability of the network of\nbeneficially exploiting the spatial correlation of the process, specially when\nthe spatial correlation coherence of the process is of the same scale as the\nclusters size. Therefore, a trade-off is established between the energy\nefficiency and the beneficial use of spatial correlation. The study of this\ntrade-off is the main goal of this paper. We derive tight approximations of the\nfalse alarm and miss-detection error probabilities under the Neyman-Pearson\nframework for the above scenario. We also consider the application of these\nresults to a particular network and correlation model obtaining closed form\nexpressions.

The initial estimate is made using a Bayesian compressive\nsensing (BCS) framework and then tracked using a Bayesian compressed sensing\nKalman filter (BCSKF). The BCS framework splits the angular region into N\npotential DOAs and enforces a belief that only a few of the DOAs will have a\nnon-zero valued signal present. A BCSKF can then be used to track the change in\nthe DOA using the same framework. There can be an issue when the DOA approaches\nthe endfire of the array. In this angular region current methods can struggle\nto accurately estimate and track changes in the DOAs. To tackle this problem,\nwe propose changing the traditional sparse belief associated with BCS to a\nbelief that the estimated signals will match the predicted signals given a\nknown DOA change.

Unfortunately, the\nfront-end A/D conversion necessary to drive hundreds of antennas, with a signal\nbandwidth of the order of 10 to 100 MHz, requires very large sampling bit-rate\nand power consumption.\n  In order to reduce such implementation requirements, Hybrid Digital-Analog\narchitectures have been proposed. In particular, our work in this paper is\nmotivated by one of such schemes named Joint Spatial Division and Multiplexing\n(JSDM), where the downlink precoder (resp., uplink linear receiver) is split\ninto the product of a baseband linear projection (digital) and an RF\nreconfigurable beamforming network (analog), such that only a reduced number $m\n\\ll M$ of A/D converters and RF modulation/demodulation chains is needed. In\nJSDM, users are grouped according to the similarity of their channel dominant\nsubspaces, and these groups are separated by the analog beamforming stage,\nwhere the multiplexing gain in each group is achieved using the digital\nprecoder. Therefore, it is apparent that extracting the channel subspace\ninformation of the $M$-dim channel vectors from snapshots of $m$-dim\nprojections, with $m \\ll M$, plays a fundamental role in JSDM implementation.\n  In this paper, we develop novel efficient algorithms that require sampling\nonly $m = O(2\\sqrt{M})$ specific array elements according to a coprime sampling\nscheme, and for a given $p \\ll M$, return a $p$-dim beamformer that has a\nperformance comparable with the best p-dim beamformer that can be designed from\nthe full knowledge of the exact channel covariance matrix.

The technique allows the SU to perform\nselective retransmissions of SU data packets that have not been successfully\ndecoded in the previous attempts. The temporal redundancy introduced by the PU\nARQ protocol and by the selective retransmission process of the SU can be\nexploited by the SU receiver to perform interference cancellation (IC) over\nmultiple transmission slots, thus creating a \"clean\" channel for the decoding\nof the concurrent SU or PU packets. The chain decoding technique is initiated\nby a successful decoding operation of a SU or PU packet and proceeds by an\niterative application of IC in order to decode the buffered signals that\nrepresent packets that could not be decoded before. Based on this scheme, an\noptimal policy is designed that maximizes the SU throughput under a constraint\non the average long-term PU performance. The optimality of the chain decoding\nprotocol is proved, which determines which packet the SU should send at a given\ntime. Moreover, a decoupling principle is proved, which establishes the\noptimality of decoupling the secondary access strategy from the chain decoding\nprotocol. Specifically, first, the SU access policy, optimized via dynamic\nprogramming, specifies whether the SU should access the channel or not, based\non a compact state representation of the protocol; and second, the chain\ndecoding protocol embeds four basic rules that are used to determine which\npacket should be transmitted by the SU. Chain decoding provably yields the\nmaximum improvement that can be achieved by any scheme under our assumptions,\nand thus it is the ultimate scheme, which completely closes the gap between\nprevious schemes and optimality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Sep 2015 18:54:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Michelusi", "Nicolo", ""], ["Popovski", "Petar", ""], ["Zorzi", "Michele", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.08083", "submitter": "Jan Vyb\\'iral", "authors": "Anton Kolleck, Jan Vyb\\'iral", "title": "Non-asymptotic Analysis of $\\ell_1$-norm Support Vector Machines", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.LG math.FA math.IT math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Support Vector Machines (SVM) with $\\ell_1$ penalty became a standard tool in\nanalysis of highdimensional classification problems with sparsity constraints\nin many applications including bioinformatics and signal processing.
