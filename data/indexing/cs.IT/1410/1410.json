In this paper, the UA communication techniques are\ndesigned and analyzed based on a geometric model. Specifically, the UA is\nmodeled as a continuous circular/spherical array enclosing target users and\nfree-space propagation is assumed. First, consider the estimation of multiuser\nUA channels induced by user locations. Given single pilot symbols, a novel\nchannel estimation scheme is proposed that decomposes training signals into\nFourier/Laplace series and thereby translates multiuser channel estimation into\npeak detection of a derive function of location. The process is shown to\nsuppress noise. Moreover, it is proved that estimation error due to\ninterference diminishes with the increasing minimum user-separation distance\nfollowing the power law, where the exponent is 1/3 and 1 for the circular and\nspherical UA, respectively. If orthogonal pilot sequences are used, channel\nestimation is found to be perfect. Next, consider channel-conjugate data\ntransmission that maximizes received signal power. The power of interference\nbetween two users is shown to decay with the increasing user-separation\ndistance sub-linearly and super-linearly for the circular and spherical UA,\nrespectively. Furthermore, a novel multiuser precoding design is proposed by\nexciting different phase modes of the UA and controlling the mode weight\nfactors to null interference.

The fact that many signals, though high dimensional, are\nintrinsically low dimensional has given the possibility to recover them stably\nfrom a relatively small number of their measurements. For example, in\ncompressed sensing with the standard (synthesis) sparsity prior and in matrix\ncompletion, the number of measurements needed is proportional (up to a\nlogarithmic factor) to the signal's manifold dimension.\n  Recently, a new natural low-dimensional signal model has been proposed: the\ncosparse analysis prior. In the noiseless case, it is possible to recover\nsignals from this model, using a combinatorial search, from a number of\nmeasurements proportional to the signal's manifold dimension. However, if we\nask for stability to noise or an efficient (polynomial complexity) solver, all\nthe existing results demand a number of measurements which is far removed from\nthe manifold dimension, sometimes far greater. Thus, it is natural to ask\nwhether this gap is a deficiency of the theory and the solvers, or if there\nexists a real barrier in recovering the cosparse signals by relying only on\ntheir manifold dimension. Is there an algorithm which, in the presence of\nnoise, can accurately recover a cosparse signal from a number of measurements\nproportional to the manifold dimension? In this work, we prove that there is no\nsuch algorithm.

Recently, we studied molecular communication between two nodes\nformed from synthetic bacteria. Due to high randomness in behavior of bacteria,\nwe used a population of them in each node.

To answer the question, we investigate relationships between\nseveral formalizations of information-theoretic security for symmetric-key\nencryption and key agreement protocols. Specifically, for symmetric-key\nencryption protocols in a general setting including the case where there exist\ndecryption-errors, we deal with the following formalizations of security:\nformalizations extended (or relaxed) from Shannon's perfect secrecy by using\nmutual information and statistical distance; information-theoretic analogues of\nindistinguishability and semantic security by Goldwasser and Micali; and\ncomposable security by Maurer et al. and Canetti.

We formulate the network utility\nmaximization problem for the downlink C-RAN under two different models\ndepending on whether the BS clustering for each user is dynamic or static over\ndifferent user scheduling time slots. In the former case, the user-centric BS\ncluster is dynamically optimized for each scheduled user along with the\nbeamforming vector in each time-frequency slot, while in the latter case the\nuser-centric BS cluster is fixed for each user and we jointly optimize the user\nscheduling and the beamforming vector to account for the backhaul constraints.\nIn both cases, the nonconvex per-BS backhaul constraints are approximated using\nthe reweighted l1-norm technique.

Blanco-Chac\\'on\net al., \"Nonuniform Fuchsian codes for noisy channels\", J. of the Franklin\nInstitute 2014] for communication over channels subject to additive white\nGaussian noise (AWGN). The two main advantages of Fuchsian codes are their\nability to compress information, i.e., high code rate, and their logarithmic\ndecoding complexity. In this paper, we improve the first property further by\nconstructing Fuchsian codes with arbitrarily high code rates while maintaining\nlogarithmic decoding complexity. Namely, in the case of Fuchsian groups derived\nfrom quaternion algebras over totally real fields we obtain a code rate that is\nproportional to the degree of the base field. In particular, we consider\narithmetic Fuchsian groups of signature (1;e) to construct explicit codes\nhaving code rate six, meaning that we can transmit six independent integers\nduring one channel use.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Oct 2014 16:14:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-23", "authors_parsed": [["Blanco-Chac\u00f3n", "Iv\u00e1n", ""], ["Hollanti", "Camilla", ""], ["Alsina", "Montserrat", ""], ["Rem\u00f3n", "Dion\u00eds", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.6289", "submitter": "Sebastian  Dorn", "authors": "Sebastian Dorn, Torsten A.

Furthermore, at the nano scale, energy\nefficiency becomes an essential problem. Before addressing these problems, a\npre-determined threshold for the received signal must be calculated to make a\ndecision. In this paper, an analytical technique is proposed to determine the\noptimum threshold, whereas in the literature, these thresholds are generally\ncalculated empirically. Since the main goal of this paper is to build an MCvD\nsystem suitable for operating at high data rates without sacrificing quality,\nnew modulation and filtering techniques are proposed to decrease the effects of\nISI and enhance energy efficiency. As a transmitter-based solution, a\nmodulation technique for MCvD, molecular transition shift keying (MTSK), is\nproposed in order to increase the data rate via suppressing the ISI.\nFurthermore, for energy efficiency, a power adjustment technique that utilizes\nthe residual molecules is proposed. Finally, as a receiver-based solution, a\nnew energy efficient decision feedback filter (DFF) is proposed as a substitute\nfor the decoders such as minimum mean squared error (MMSE) and decision\nfeedback equalizer (DFE). The error performance of DFF and MMSE equalizers are\ncompared in terms of bit error rates, and it is concluded that DFF may be more\nadvantageous when energy efficiency is concerned, due to its lower\ncomputational complexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Oct 2014 10:26:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-31", "authors_parsed": [["Tepekule", "Burcu", ""], ["Pusane", "Ali E.", ""], ["Yilmaz", "H.

The proposed\nscheme utilizes Integer Forcing Linear Receiver (IFLR) at relay, which uses\nequations, i.e., linear integer-combinations of messages, to harness the\nintra-pair interference. Accordingly, we propose the design of mean squared\nerror (MSE) based transceiver, including precoder and projection matrices for\nthe relay and users, assuming that the perfect channel state information (CSI)\nis available. In this regards, in the multiple-access phase, we introduce two\nnew MSE criteria for the related precoding and filter designs, i.e., the sum of\nthe equations MSE (Sum-Equation MSE) and the maximum of the equations MSE\n(Max-Equation MSE), to exploit the equations in the relay. In addition, the\nconvergence of the proposed criteria is proven as well. Moreover, in the\nbroadcast phase, we use the two traditional MSE criteria, i.e. the sum of the\nusers' mean squred errors (Sum MSE) and the maximum of the users' mean squared\nerrors (Max MSE), to design the related precoding and filters for recovering\nrelay's equations by the users. Then, we consider a more practical scenario\nwith imperfect CSI. For this case, IFLR receiver is modified, and another\ntransceiver design is proposed, which take into account the effect of channels\nestimation error.
