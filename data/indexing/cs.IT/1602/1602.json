To reduce the\nreliance on unsustainable energy sources, one can adopt self-powered SBSs that\nrely solely on energy harvesting. Due to the uncertainty of energy arrival and\nthe finite capacity of energy storage systems, self-powered SBSs must smartly\noptimize their ON and OFF schedule.

To solve the approximated problem, a novel approach\nbased on the ski rental framework, a powerful online optimization tool, is\nproposed. Using this approach, each SBS can effectively decide on its ON/OFF\nschedule autonomously, without any prior information on future energy arrivals.\nBy using competitive analysis, a deterministic online algorithm (DOA) and a\nrandomized online algorithm (ROA) are developed.

Reaping the\nbenefits of a dual-mode operation requires scheduling mechanisms that can\nallocate resources efficiently and jointly at both frequency bands. In this\npaper, a novel resource allocation framework is proposed that exploits users'\ncontext, in terms of user application (UA) delay requirements, to maximize the\nquality-of-service (QoS) of a dual-mode base station. In particular, such a\ncontext-aware approach enables the network to dynamically schedule UAs, instead\nof users, thus providing more precise delay guarantees and a more efficient\nexploitation of the mmW resources. The scheduling of UAs is formulated as a\none-to-many matching problem between UAs and resources and a novel algorithm is\nproposed to solve it.

This robust problem deals with a\ngeneral-rank transmit covariance design, and it follows a safe rate-constrained\nformulation under spherically bounded CSI uncertainties. Curiously, simulation\nresults in previous works suggested that the robust problem admits rank-one\noptimal transmit covariances in most cases. Such a numerical finding is\nappealing because transmission with rank-one covariances can be easily realized\nby single-stream transmit beamforming. This gives rise to a fundamentally\nimportant question, namely, whether we can theoretically identify conditions\nunder which the robust problem admits a rank-one solution. In this paper, we\nidentify one such condition. Simply speaking, we show that the robust problem\nis guaranteed to admit a rank-one solution if the CSI uncertainties are not too\nlarge and the multiuser channel is not too poorly conditioned. To establish the\naforementioned condition, we develop a novel duality framework, through which\nan intimate relationship between the robust problem and a related maximin\nproblem is revealed. Our condition involves only a simple expression with\nrespect to the multiuser channel and other system parameters. In particular,\nunlike other sufficient rank-one conditions that have appeared in the\nliterature, ours is verifiable. The application of our analysis framework to\nseveral other CSI uncertainty models is also discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Feb 2016 06:24:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 13 Jul 2016 09:22:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 31 Dec 2016 04:13:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["Ma", "Wing-Kin", ""], ["Pan", "Jiaxian", ""], ["So", "Anthony Man-Cho", ""], ["Chang", "Tsung-Hui", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.01577", "submitter": "Heeyoul Kwak", "authors": "Heeyoul Kwak, Bohwan Jun, Pilwoong Yang, Jong-Seon No, Dong-Joon Shin", "title": "New Coupled Codes Constructed by Overlapping Circular SC-LDPC Codes", "comments": "We want to remove the paper because it will be unpublished", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we propose new coupled codes constructed by overlapping\ncircular spatially-coupled low-density parity-check (SC-LDPC) codes, which show\nbetter asymptotic and finite-length decoding performance compared to the\nconventional SC-LDPC codes.

Such codes trade the bandwidth needed to repair a\nfailed node with the overall amount of data stored in the network. Minimum\nstorage regenerating (MSR) codes are an important class of optimal regenerating\ncodes that minimize (first) the amount of data stored per node and (then) the\nrepair bandwidth. Specifically, an $[n,k,d]$-$(\\alpha)$ MSR code $\\mathbb{C}$\nover $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is defined as follows. Using such a code $\\mathbb{C}$, a\nfile $\\cal{F}$ consisting of $\\alpha k$ symbols over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ can be\ndistributed among $n$ nodes, each storing $\\alpha$ symbols, in such a way that:\nThe file $\\cal{F}$ can be recovered by downloading the content of any $k$ of\nthe $n$ nodes; and the content of any failed node can be reconstructed by\naccessing any $d$ of the remaining $n-1$ nodes and downloading $\\alpha/(d-k+1)$\nsymbols from each of these nodes. Unfortunately, explicit constructions of\n$[n,k,d]$ MSR codes are known only for certain special cases: either low rate,\nnamely $k/n<0.5$, or high repair connectivity, namely $d = n-1$. Although\nsetting $d = n-1$ minimizes the repair bandwidth, it may be impractical to\nconnect to all the remaining nodes in order to repair a single failed node. Our\nmain result in this paper is an explicit construction of systematic-repair\n$[n,k,d]$ MSR codes for all possible values of parameters $n,k,d$. In\nparticular, we construct systematic-repair MSR codes of high rate $k/n>0.5$ and\nlow repair connectivity $k< d<n-1$. Such codes were not previously known to\nexist. In order to construct these codes, we solve simultaneously several\nrepair scenarios, each of which is expressible as an interference alignment\nproblem.

In this\npaper, we consider a commercialized small-cell caching system consisting of a\nnetwork service provider (NSP), several video retailers (VR), and mobile users\n(MU).

After showing that the\nmultiscale processing of a vector autoregressive (VAR) process introduces a\nmoving average (MA) component, we describe how to represent the resulting VARMA\nprocess using state-space (SS) models and how to exploit the SS model\nparameters to compute analytical measures of information storage and\ninformation transfer for the original and rescaled processes. The framework is\nthen used to quantify multiscale information dynamics for simulated\nunidirectionally and bidirectionally coupled VAR processes, showing that\nrescaling may lead to insightful patterns of information storage and transfer\nbut also to potentially misleading behaviors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Feb 2016 14:05:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 24 Feb 2016 20:22:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-25", "authors_parsed": [["Faes", "Luca", ""], ["Montalto", "Alessandro", ""], ["Stramaglia", "Sebastiano", ""], ["Nollo", "Giandomenico", ""], ["Marinazzo", "Daniele", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.06156", "submitter": "Valerio Bioglio", "authors": "Frederic Gabry and Valerio Bioglio and Ingmar Land", "title": "On Edge Caching with Secrecy Constraints", "comments": "to appear in ICC 2016", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we investigate the problem of optimal cache placement under\nsecrecy constraints in heterogeneous networks, where small-cell base stations\nare equipped with caches to reduce the overall backhaul load.

Examples and simulation results show that the\nbeam alignment overhead can be reduced by using position information obtained\nfrom DSRC.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 20 Feb 2016 20:42:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 18 May 2016 21:31:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Choi", "Junil", ""], ["Va", "Vutha", ""], ["Gonzalez-Prelcic", "Nuria", ""], ["Daniels", "Robert", ""], ["Bhat", "Chandra R.", ""], ["Heath", "Robert W.", "Jr"]]}, {"id": "1602.06500", "submitter": "Xiaoxiao Wu", "authors": "Sissi Xiaoxiao Wu, Anthony Man-Cho So, Jiaxian Pan, and Wing-Kin Ma", "title": "Some Proof Derivations and Further Simulation Results for \"Semidefinite\n  Relaxation and Approximation Analysis of a Beamformed Alamouti Scheme for\n  Relay Beamforming Networks\"", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This is a companion technical report of the main manuscript \"Semidefinite\nRelaxation and Approximation Analysis of a Beamformed Alamouti Scheme for Relay\nBeamforming Networks\".

The proposed video codec uses only 7% of the total\nnumber of multipliers needed in a conventional CS-based video coding system. A\ncodebook of Bernoulli matrices with different sizes corresponding to the\npredefined sparsity levels is maintained at both the encoder and the decoder.\nBased on the calculated l0-norm of the input vector, one of the sixteen\npossible Bernoulli matrices will be selected for taking the CS measurements and\nits index will be transmitted along with the measurements. Based on this index,\nthe corresponding Bernoulli matrix has been used in CS reconstruction algorithm\nto get back the high-frequency wavelet sub-bands at the decoder. At the\ndecoder, a new Enhanced Approximate Message Passing (EAMP) algorithm has been\nproposed to reconstruct the wavelet coefficients and apply the inverse wavelet\ntransform for restoring back the video frames. Simulation results have\nestablished the superiority of the proposed framework over the existing schemes\nand have increased its suitability for VLSI implementation. Moreover, the coded\nvideo is found to be scalable with an increase in a number of levels of wavelet\ndecomposition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Feb 2016 10:08:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-25", "authors_parsed": [["Srinivasarao", "B.

For covariant channels, the meta-converse also leads to\nsecond-order expansions of relative entropy of entanglement bounds for private\ncommunication rates. For such channels, the bounds also apply to the private\ncommunication setting in which the sender and receiver are assisted by\nunlimited public classical communication, and as such, they are relevant for\nestablishing various converse bounds for quantum key distribution protocols\nconducted over these channels.
