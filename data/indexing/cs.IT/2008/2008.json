We first show at high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) that\nPP-RSMA achieves the optimum Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) in an overloaded MISO BC\nwith heterogeneous CSIT qualities and then show at finite SNR that, by marrying\nthe benefits of PP and RSMA, PP-RSMA achieves explicit sum rate gain over\nTP-RSMA and all baseline schemes. Furthermore, PP-RSMA is robust to CSIT\ninaccuracy and flexible to cope with Quality of Service (QoS) rate constraints\nof all users. The DoF and rate analysis helps us draw the conclusion that\nPP-RSMA is a powerful framework for cellular IoT with a large number of\ndevices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Aug 2020 23:12:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-05", "authors_parsed": [["Mao", "Yijie", ""], ["Piovano", "Enrico", ""], ["Clerckx", "Bruno", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.01239", "submitter": "Cong Luong Nguyen", "authors": "Nguyen Cong Luong, Nguyen Thi Thanh Van, Feng Shaohan, Huy T.

Wu devised a fast polynomial-update algorithm to construct the\nerror-locator polynomial (ELP) as the solution of a certain linear-feedback\nshift register (LFSR) synthesis problem. This results in a conceptually\ncomplicated algorithm, divided into $8$ subtly different cases. Moreover, Wu's\npolynomial-update algorithm is not immediately suitable for working with\nvectors of evaluations. Therefore, complicated modifications were required in\norder to achieve a true \"one-pass\" Chase decoding algorithm, that is, a Chase\ndecoding algorithm requiring $O(n)$ operations per modified coordinate, where\n$n$ is the RS code length.\n  The main result of the current paper is a conceptually simple syndrome-based\nfast Chase decoding of RS codes. Instead of developing a theory from scratch,\nwe use the well-established theory of Groebner bases for modules over\n$\\mathbb{F}_q[X]$ (where $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is the finite field of $q$ elements,\nfor $q$ a prime power). The basic observation is that instead of Wu's LFSR\nsynthesis problem, it is much simpler to consider \"the right\" module\nminimization problem. The solution to this minimization problem is a simple\npolynomial-update algorithm that avoids syndrome updates and works seamlessly\nwith vectors of evaluations. As a result, we obtain a conceptually simple\nalgorithm for one-pass Chase decoding of RS codes. Our algorithm is general\nenough to work with any algorithm that finds a Groebner basis for the solution\nmodule of the key equation as the initial algorithm, and it is not tied only to\nthe BM algorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Aug 2020 19:52:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 07:21:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-21", "authors_parsed": [["Shany", "Yaron", ""], ["Berman", "Amit", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.01834", "submitter": "Cong Ling", "authors": "Charles Grover, Cong Ling, Roope Vehkalahti", "title": "Non-Commutative Ring Learning With Errors From Cyclic Algebras", "comments": "Full version of a paper previously posted on IACR eprint", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT math.NT math.RA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Learning with Errors (LWE) problem is the fundamental backbone of modern\nlattice based cryptography, allowing one to establish cryptography on the\nhardness of well-studied computational problems.

We design new quantum error-correcting codes\nspecifically for efficient error correction, e.g., allowing single-shot error\ncorrection. For codes with multiple logical qubits, we give methods for\ncombining error correction with partial logical measurements. There are\ntradeoffs in choosing a code and error-correction technique. While to date most\nwork has concentrated on optimizing the syndrome-extraction procedure, we show\nthat there are also substantial benefits to optimizing how the measured\nsyndromes are chosen and used. As an example, we design single-shot measurement\nsequences for fault-tolerant quantum error correction with the 16-qubit\nextended Hamming code. Our scheme uses 10 syndrome bit measurements, compared\nto 40 measurements with the Shor scheme. We design single-shot logical\nmeasurements as well: any logical Z measurement can be made together with\nfault-tolerant error correction using only 11 measurements. For comparison,\nusing the Shor scheme a basic implementation of such a non-destructive logical\nmeasurement uses 63 measurements. We also offer ten open problems, the\nsolutions of which could lead to substantial improvements of fault-tolerant\nerror correction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Aug 2020 01:01:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-13", "authors_parsed": [["Delfosse", "Nicolas", ""], ["Reichardt", "Ben W.", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.05067", "submitter": "Jiayu Li", "authors": "Feng Shu, Jiayu Li, Mengxing Huang, Weiping Shi, Yin Teng, Jun Li,\n  Yongpeng Wu, Jiangzhou Wang", "title": "Enhanced Secrecy Rate Maximization for Directional Modulation Networks\n  via IRS", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT eess.SP math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is of low-cost and energy-efficiency and\nwill be a promising technology for the future wireless communications like\nsixth generation.

Consider a VLC\nsystem, where two entrusted users close to a VLC access point (AP) help an\nout-of-coverage legitimate user using RF signals in the presence of an\neavesdropper. The AP transmits data to both entrusted users and the legitimate\nuser using the principle of NOMA, where the entrusted users harvest energy from\nthe received light intensity, decode the legitimate user's message, forward it\nusing a RF link, and then decode their messages. It is required to maximize the\nsecrecy rate at the legitimate user under quality-of-service (QoS) constraints\nusing beamforming and DC-bias and power allocation. Different solutions are\nproposed for both active and passive eavesdropper cases, using semidefinite\nrelaxation, zero-forcing, beamforming, and jamming.

Channel estimation via ML requires model training on a\ndataset, which usually includes the received pilot signals as input and channel\ndata as output. In previous works, model training is mostly done in a\ncentralized manner, where the whole training dataset is collected from the\nusers at the base station (BS). This approach introduces huge transmission\noverhead for data collection from the users. In this paper, to address this\nchallenge, we propose a federated learning (FL) framework for channel\nestimation. We design a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the local\ndatasets of the users without sending them to the BS. We develop FL-based\nchannel estimation schemes for both conventional and IRS (intelligent\nreflecting surface) assisted massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output)\nsystems, where a single CNN is trained for two different datasets for both\nscenarios. Even if the IRS-assisted massive MIMO includes two different\nchannels, namely the direct and cascaded channels, their estimation is\nperformed with a single CNN, without using multiple CNNs for each task. Via\nnumerical simulations, we evaluate the performance for noisy and quantized\nmodel transmission and show that the proposed approach provides approximately\n16 times lower transmission overhead than the centralized learning (CL)\nschemes, while maintaining satisfactory channel estimation performance close to\nCL. Furthermore, the proposed CNN architecture exhibits lower estimation error\nthan the state-of-the-art ML-based channel estimation schemes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Aug 2020 06:51:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-26", "authors_parsed": [["Elbir", "Ahmet M.", ""], ["Coleri", "Sinem", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.10901", "submitter": "Liang Liu", "authors": "Liang Liu, Ya-Feng Liu, Pratik Patil, Wei Yu", "title": "Uplink-Downlink Duality Between Multiple-Access and Broadcast Channels\n  with Compressing Relays", "comments": "submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory; 63 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT eess.SP math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Uplink-downlink duality refers to the fact that under a sum-power constraint,\nthe capacity regions of a Gaussian multiple-access channel and a Gaussian\nbroadcast channel with Hermitian transposed channel matrices are identical.\nThis paper generalizes this result to a cooperative cellular network, in which\nremote access-points are deployed as relays in serving the users under the\ncoordination of a central processor (CP).

The malicious IRS is utilized for performing attack by randomly\nreflecting data sequences of legitimate users (LUs) to a base station (BS). We\nfind that the data sequences of LUs are correlative to the signals reflected by\nmalicious IRS. The correlation undermines the performance of traditional\neigenvalue decomposition (EVD)-based channel estimation (CE) methods. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a empirical-distribution-based channel\nestimation approach in the presence of malicious IRS. The proposed method works\nby capturing desired convex hulls from signals disturbed by malicious IRS, on\nthe basis of its empirical distribution.
