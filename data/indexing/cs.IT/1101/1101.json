We begin by\nestablishing the one-to-one correspondence between a linear function family\n{\\cal F} and a code family {\\cal C}, and thereby defining \\varepsilon-almost\ndual universal_2 hash functions, as a generalization of the conventional\nuniversal_2 hash functions. Then we show that this generalized (and thus\nbroader) class of hash functions is in fact sufficient for the security of\nquantum cryptography. This result can be explained in two different formalisms.\nFirst, by noting its relation to the \\delta-biased family introduced by Dodis\nand Smith, we demonstrate that Renner's two-universal hashing lemma is\ngeneralized to our class of hash functions. Next, we prove that the proof\ntechnique by Shor and Preskill can be applied to quantum key distribution (QKD)\nsystems that use our generalized class of hash functions for privacy\namplification. While Shor-Preskill formalism requires an implementer of a QKD\nsystem to explicitly construct a linear code of the Calderbank-Shor-Steane\ntype, this result removes the existing difficulty of the construction a linear\ncode of CSS code by replacing it by the combination of an ordinary classical\nerror correcting code and our proposed hash function. We also show that a\nsimilar result applies to the quantum wire-tap channel. Finally we compare our\nresults in the two formalisms and show that, in typical QKD scenarios, the\nShor-Preskill--type argument gives better security bounds in terms of the trace\ndistance and Holevo information, than the method based on the \\delta-biased\nfamily.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Dec 2010 10:24:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 24 Jan 2011 09:19:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 8 Feb 2012 10:59:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 13 Nov 2012 08:06:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-18", "authors_parsed": [["Tsurumaru", "Toyohiro", ""], ["Hayashi", "Masahito", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.0085", "submitter": "Rathinakumar Appuswamy", "authors": "Rathinakumar Appuswamy, Massimo Franceschetti, Nikhil Karamchandani,\n  and Kenneth Zeger", "title": "Linear Codes, Target Function Classes, and Network Computing Capacity", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.DC math.CO math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the use of linear codes for network computing in single-receiver\nnetworks with various classes of target functions of the source messages.

Over one frame interval, each node\nbroadcasts a message to neighbors and simultaneously decodes neighbors'\nmessages based on the superposed signals received through its own off-slots.\nThus the solution fully exploits the multiaccess nature of the wireless medium\nand addresses the half-duplex constraint at the fundamental level.

This paper examines the problem of multiuser detection (MUD) in random\naccess channels for such applications. Traditional orthogonal signaling ignores\nthe random nature of user activity in this problem and limits the total number\nof users to be on the order of the number of signal space dimensions.\nContention-based schemes, on the other hand, suffer from delays caused by\ncolliding transmissions and the hidden node problem. In contrast, this paper\npresents a novel pairing of an asynchronous non-orthogonal code-division random\naccess scheme with a convex optimization-based MUD algorithm that overcomes the\nissues associated with orthogonal signaling and contention-based methods. Two\nkey distinguishing features of the proposed MUD algorithm are that it does not\nrequire knowledge of the delay or channel state information of every user and\nit has polynomial-time computational complexity. The main analytical\ncontribution of this paper is the relationship between the performance of the\nproposed MUD algorithm in the presence of arbitrary or random delays and two\nsimple metrics of the set of user codewords. The study of these metrics is then\nfocused on two specific sets of codewords, random binary codewords and\nspecially constructed algebraic codewords, for asynchronous random access. The\nensuing analysis confirms that the proposed scheme together with either of\nthese two codeword sets significantly outperforms the orthogonal\nsignaling-based random access in terms of the total number of users in the\nsystem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Jan 2011 17:14:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 20 Jun 2011 23:21:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-06", "authors_parsed": [["Applebaum", "Lorne", ""], ["Bajwa", "Waheed U.", ""], ["Duarte", "Marco F.", ""], ["Calderbank", "Robert", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.1515", "submitter": "Chuan Huang", "authors": "Chuan Huang, Jinhua Jiang, Shuguang Cui", "title": "On the Achievable Rates of the Diamond Relay Channel with Conferencing\n  Links", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a half-duplex diamond relay channel, which consists of one\nsource-destination pair and two relay nodes connected with two-way rate-limited\nout-of-band conferencing links.
