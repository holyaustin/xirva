One of the main challenges in caching is\nchoosing the files that are going to be stored in the memory of SBS. In this\npaper, we model the described caching problem as a graph. This graph is divided\ninto four sub-graphs including placement, access, SBSs and delivery graphs. By\nmaking some modifications to the SBS graph, we convert it to a graph that can\nbe colored.

For the former case, it is shown that\na simple hover-fly-hover (HFH) UAV trajectory with time division multiple\naccess (TDMA) based orthogonal multiuser transmission is capacity-achieving,\nwhile in the latter case, the UAV should hover at a fixed location that is\nnearer to the user with larger achievable rate and in general superposition\ncoding (SC) based non-orthogonal transmission with interference cancellation at\nthe receiver of the nearer user is required. Next, we consider the general case\nwith finite UAV speed and flight duration. We show that the optimal UAV\ntrajectory should follow a general HFH structure, i.e., the UAV successively\nhovers at a pair of initial and final locations above the line segment of the\ntwo users each with a certain amount of time and flies unidirectionally between\nthem at the maximum speed, and SC is generally needed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Jan 2018 13:37:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 6 Jan 2018 06:55:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-09", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Qingqing", ""], ["Xu", "Jie", ""], ["Zhang", "Rui", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.00444", "submitter": "Qingqing Wu", "authors": "Qingqing Wu and Rui Zhang", "title": "Common Throughput Maximization in UAV-Enabled OFDMA Systems with Delay\n  Consideration", "comments": "[UAV-Enabled Aerial Base Station (BS) II] Submitted to IEEE\n  Transactions on Communications.

The paper explains the implementation details of network\ncoding in real scenarios and describes the effect of the field size on network\ncoding.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 7 Jan 2018 03:26:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-09", "authors_parsed": [["Kafaie", "Somayeh", ""], ["Chen", "Yuanzhu Peter", ""], ["Dobre", "Octavia A.", ""], ["Ahmed", "Mohamed Hossam", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.02158", "submitter": "Jialin Dong", "authors": "Jialin Dong, Kai Yang, and Yuanming Shi", "title": "Blind Demixing for Low-Latency Communication", "comments": "14 pages, accepted by IEEE Transaction on Wireless Communication", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the next generation wireless networks, lowlatency communication is\ncritical to support emerging diversified applications, e.g., Tactile Internet\nand Virtual Reality.

In decode-and-forward, the relay\ncompletely decodes the message and sends some information to the destination;\nin compress-and-forward, the relay does not decode, and it sends a compressed\nversion of the received signal to the destination using Wyner-Ziv coding. In\nthis paper, we present a novel coding paradigm that provides an improved\nachievable rate for the primitive relay channel. The idea is to combine\ncompress-and-forward and decode-and-forward via a chaining construction. We\ntransmit over pairs of blocks: in the first block, we use compress-and-forward;\nand in the second block, we use decode-and-forward. More specifically, in the\nfirst block, the relay does not decode, it compresses the received signal via\nWyner-Ziv, and it sends only part of the compression to the destination. In the\nsecond block, the relay completely decodes the message, it sends some\ninformation to the destination, and it also sends the remaining part of the\ncompression coming from the first block. By doing so, we are able to strictly\noutperform both compress-and-forward and decode-and-forward. Note that the\nproposed coding scheme can be implemented with polar codes. As such, it has the\ntypical attractive properties of polar coding schemes, namely, quasi-linear\nencoding and decoding complexity, and error probability that decays at\nsuper-polynomial speed.

We then present an alternate\ndirect proof of the sufficient condition when $a=1, h=0$. We later extend our\ntechnique to study the topology for $a=2, h=0$, and characterize a subset of\nrecoverable erasure patterns in that case. For both $a=1, 2$, our method of\nproof is uniform, i.e., by constructing tensor product $G_{\\text{col}} \\otimes\nG_{\\text{row}}$ of generator matrices of column and row codes such that certain\nsquare sub-matrices retain full rank. The full-rank condition is proved by\nresorting to the matching identified earlier and also another set of matchings\nin erasure sub-patterns.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Jan 2018 13:58:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-11", "authors_parsed": [["Shivakrishna", "D.", ""], ["Rameshwar", "V.

In general, in order to decode its\ndemanded message symbol, a receiver may have to observe the entire transmitted\ncodeword. Querying or downloading the codeword symbols might involve costs to a\nclient -- such as network utilization costs and storage requirements for the\nqueried symbols to perform decoding. In traditional index coding solutions,\nthis 'client aware' perspective is not considered during code design. As a\nresult, for these codes, the number of codeword symbols queried by a client per\ndecoded message symbol, which we refer to as 'locality', could be large. In\nthis paper, considering locality as a cost parameter, we view index coding as a\ntrade-off between the achievable broadcast rate (codeword length normalized by\nthe message length) and locality, where the objective is to minimize the\nbroadcast rate for a given value of locality and vice versa. We show that the\nsmallest possible locality for any index coding problem is 1, and that the\noptimal index coding solution with locality 1 is the coding scheme based on\nfractional coloring of the interference graph. We propose index coding schemes\nwith small locality by covering the side information graph using acyclic\nsubgraphs and subgraphs with small minrank. We also show how locality can be\naccounted for in conventional partition multicast and cycle covering solutions\nto index coding. Finally, applying these new techniques, we characterize the\nlocality-broadcast rate trade-off of the index coding problem whose side\ninformation graph is the directed 3-cycle.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:41:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-12", "authors_parsed": [["Natarajan", "Lakshmi", ""], ["Krishnan", "Prasad", ""], ["Lalitha", "V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.03920", "submitter": "Jake Perazzone", "authors": "Jake Perazzone and Eric Graves and Paul Yu and Rick Blum", "title": "Inner Bound for the Capacity Region of Noisy Channels with an\n  Authentication Requirement", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The rate regions of many variations of the standard and wire-tap channels\nhave been thoroughly explored.

The UAV employs the\nradio frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) to charge the users in the\ndownlink, and the users use the harvested RF energy to send independent\ninformation to the UAV in the uplink. Unlike the conventional WPCN with fixed\nAPs, the UAV-enabled WPCN can exploit the mobility of the UAV via trajectory\ndesign, jointly with the wireless resource allocation optimization, to maximize\nthe system throughput. In particular, we aim to maximize the uplink common\n(minimum) throughput among all ground users over a finite UAV's flight period,\nsubject to its maximum speed constraint and the users' energy neutrality\nconstraints.

However, a major impediment in deducing the graph\ndistribution is that it requires the joint probability distribution of the\n$n(n-1)/2$ distances between $n$ nodes randomly distributed in a bounded\ndomain. As no such result exists in the literature, we make progress by\nobtaining the joint distribution of the distances between three nodes confined\nin a disk in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This enables the calculation of the probability\ndistribution and entropy of a three-node graph. For arbitrary $n$, we derive a\nseries of upper bounds on the graph entropy; in particular, the bound involving\nthe entropy of a three-node graph is tighter than the existing bound which\nassumes distances are independent. Finally, we provide numerical results on\ngraph connectedness and the tightness of the derived entropy bounds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Jan 2018 11:54:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-16", "authors_parsed": [["Badiu", "Mihai-Alin", ""], ["Coon", "Justin P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.04761", "submitter": "Maxime Ferreira Da Costa", "authors": "Maxime Ferreira Da Costa and Wei Dai", "title": "A Tight Converse to the Spectral Resolution Limit via Convex Programming", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.FA math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It is now well understood that convex programming can be used to estimate the\nfrequency components of a spectrally sparse signal from $2m+1$ uniform temporal\nmeasurements.

In this paper, we\nfocus on the problem of channel estimation in massive MIMO systems, while\naddressing these two challenges: We jointly design the pilot sequences to\nmitigate the effect of pilot contamination and propose an analog combiner which\nmaps the high number of sensors to a low number of RF chains, thus reducing the\ncomputational and hardware cost.

The problem is cast as a dynamic game among\nUAVs. To solve this game, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, based on\necho state network (ESN) cells, is proposed. The introduced deep ESN\narchitecture is trained to allow each UAV to map each observation of the\nnetwork state to an action, with the goal of minimizing a sequence of\ntime-dependent utility functions. Each UAV uses ESN to learn its optimal path,\ntransmission power level, and cell association vector at different locations\nalong its path.

As in the model\nrecently introduced by Polyanskiy for the Multiple Access Channel (MAC) with a\nfixed, known number of transmitters, the channel is assumed to be invariant to\npermutations on its inputs, and all active transmitters employ identical\nencoders. Unlike the Polyanskiy model, in the proposed scenario, neither the\ntransmitters nor the receiver knows which transmitters are active. We refer to\nthis agnostic communication setup as the Random Access Channel (RAC). Scheduled\nfeedback of a finite number of bits is used to synchronize the transmitters.\nThe decoder is tasked with determining from the channel output the number of\nactive transmitters, $k$, and their messages but not which transmitter sent\nwhich message. The decoding procedure occurs at a time $n_t$ depending on the\ndecoder's estimate, $t$, of the number of active transmitters, $k$, thereby\nachieving a rate that varies with the number of active transmitters. Single-bit\nfeedback at each time $n_i, i \\leq t$, enables all transmitters to determine\nthe end of one coding epoch and the start of the next. The central result of\nthis work demonstrates the achievability on a RAC of performance that is\nfirst-order optimal for the MAC in operation during each coding epoch.
