The goal is to maximize the weighted sum rate of the system by jointly\noptimizing subcarrier pairing and power allocation on each subcarrier in each\nhop. The weighting of the rates is to take into account the fact that different\nsubcarriers may carry signals for different services.

By targeting the low Hamming-weight interleaved errors of the outer\nconvolutional code, which are responsible for low Euclidean-weight errors in\nthe Viterbi trellis, the turbo equalizer with an error-pattern correcting code\n(TE-EPCC) exhibits a much lower bit-error rate (BER) floor compared to the\nconventional non-precoded TE, especially for high rate applications. A\nmaximum-likelihood upper bound is developed on the BER floor of the TE-EPCC for\na generalized two-tap ISI channel, in order to study TE-EPCC's signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) gain for various channel conditions and design parameters. In\naddition, the SNR gain of the TE-EPCC relative to an existing precoded TE is\ncompared to demonstrate the present TE's superiority for short interleaver\nlengths and high coding rates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Mar 2010 19:39:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 30 Mar 2010 00:28:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Alhussien", "Hakim", ""], ["Moon", "Jaekyun", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.5693", "submitter": "Abdel-Hakim Alhussien", "authors": "Hakim Alhussien and Jaekyun Moon", "title": "An Iteratively Decodable Tensor Product Code with Application to Data\n  Storage", "comments": "Hakim Alhussien, Jaekyun Moon, \"An Iteratively Decodable Tensor\n  Product Code with Application to Data Storage\"", "journal-ref": "IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, vol.28, no.2,\n  pp.228-240, February 2010.", "doi": "10.1109/JSAC.2010.100212", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The error pattern correcting code (EPCC) can be constructed to provide a\nsyndrome decoding table targeting the dominant error events of an inter-symbol\ninterference channel at the output of the Viterbi detector. For the size of the\nsyndrome table to be manageable and the list of possible error events to be\nreasonable in size, the codeword length of EPCC needs to be short enough.\nHowever, the rate of such a short length code will be too low for hard drive\napplications. To accommodate the required large redundancy, it is possible to\nrecord only a highly compressed function of the parity bits of EPCC's tensor\nproduct with a symbol correcting code.

In a traditional linear receiver architecture, the\nreceive antennas are used to separate out the codewords sent by each transmit\nantenna, which can then be decoded individually. Although easy to implement,\nthis approach can be highly suboptimal when the channel matrix is near\nsingular. This paper develops a new linear receiver architecture that uses the\nreceive antennas to create an effective channel matrix with integer-valued\nentries. Rather than attempting to recover transmitted codewords directly, the\ndecoder recovers integer combinations of the codewords according to the entries\nof the effective channel matrix. The codewords are all generated using the same\nlinear code which guarantees that these integer combinations are themselves\ncodewords. Provided that the effective channel is full rank, these integer\ncombinations can then be digitally solved for the original codewords. This\npaper focuses on the special case where there is no coding across transmit\nantennas and no channel state information at the transmitter(s), which\ncorresponds either to a multi-user uplink scenario or to single-user V-BLAST\nencoding. In this setting, the proposed integer-forcing linear receiver\nsignificantly outperforms conventional linear architectures such as the\nzero-forcing and linear MMSE receiver. In the high SNR regime, the proposed\nreceiver attains the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff for the standard\nMIMO channel with no coding across transmit antennas. It is further shown that\nin an extended MIMO model with interference, the integer-forcing linear\nreceiver achieves the optimal generalized degrees-of-freedom.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Mar 2010 03:57:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 2 Jan 2012 21:12:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 4 Feb 2013 04:41:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 5 Aug 2014 16:54:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-06", "authors_parsed": [["Zhan", "Jiening", ""], ["Nazer", "Bobak", ""], ["Erez", "Uri", ""], ["Gastpar", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.5993", "submitter": "Xiangyong Zeng", "authors": "Xiangyong Zeng and Jinyong Shan and Lei Hu", "title": "A Triple-Error-Correcting Cyclic Code from the Gold and Kasami-Welch APN\n  Power Functions", "comments": "29 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Based on a sufficient condition proposed by Hollmann and Xiang for\nconstructing triple-error-correcting codes, the minimum distance of a binary\ncyclic code $\\mathcal{C}_{1,3,13}$ with three zeros $\\alpha$, $\\alpha^3$, and\n$\\alpha^{13}$ of length $2^m-1$ and the weight divisibility of its dual code\nare studied, where $m\\geq 5$ is odd and $\\alpha$ is a primitive element of the\nfinite field $\\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$.
