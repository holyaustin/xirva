Distributed gradient descent (GD) is widely employed to\nparallelize the learning task by distributing the dataset across multiple\nworkers. A significant performance bottleneck for the per-iteration completion\ntime in distributed synchronous GD is $straggling$ workers. Coded distributed\ncomputation techniques have been introduced recently to mitigate stragglers and\nto speed up GD iterations by assigning redundant computations to workers. In\nthis paper, we consider gradient coding (GC), and propose a novel dynamic GC\nscheme, which assigns redundant data to workers to acquire the flexibility to\ndynamically choose from among a set of possible codes depending on the past\nstraggling behavior.

This paper studies\ndistributed Bayesian learning in a wireless data center setting encompassing a\ncentral server and multiple distributed workers. Prior work on wireless\ndistributed learning has focused exclusively on frequentist learning, and has\nintroduced the idea of leveraging uncoded transmission to enable \"over-the-air\"\ncomputing.

This work investigates for the first time the design of\ndistributed one-shot, or \"embarrassingly parallel\", Bayesian learning protocols\nin wireless data centers via consensus Monte Carlo (CMC). Uncoded transmission\nis introduced not only as a way to implement \"over-the-air\" computing, but also\nas a mechanism to deploy channel-driven MC sampling: Rather than treating\nchannel noise as a nuisance to be mitigated, channel-driven sampling utilizes\nchannel noise as an integral part of the MC sampling process. A simple wireless\nCMC scheme is first proposed that is asymptotically optimal under Gaussian\nlocal posteriors.

We believe that this type of\nresult may make it possible to rigorously consider 'weak' experiments, where\nthe causal variable is not entirely independent from the environment, but only\napproximately so. More generally, we suggest a connection between the theory of\ncausality to polynomial optimization, which give useful bounds on the space of\ninterventional distributions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Mar 2021 05:01:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Shu", "Kevin", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.02928", "submitter": "Eduin Hernandez", "authors": "Busra Tegin, Eduin.

In the context of multi-hop\nnetworks, which is a classic example for multi-party communication, recent\nstudies have shown that automatic-repeat-request (ARQ) based decode-and-forward\n(DF) strategies are suitable for URLLC since the idea of distributing a given\nnumber of ARQs across the nodes provides fine control on the features of\nreliability and latency. Inspired by these developments, in this work, we\npropose a cooperative ARQ sharing strategy for URLLC in multi-hop networks. At\nthe heart of the proposed scheme lies the idea that every node is given the\nknowledge of the number of ARQs allotted to its preceding node in addition to\nthe ARQs allotted to itself. As a result, each node only needs to count the\nnumber of unsuccessful attempts of its preceding node, and then borrow the\nunused ARQs, thereby improving the reliability feature with no compromise in\nthe latency constraint. Using packet-drop-probability (PDP) as the reliability\nmetric for the proposed cooperative strategy, we formulate an optimization\nproblem of minimizing the PDP subject to a sum constraint on the total number\nof ARQs allotted across all the nodes. Supported by theoretical analysis on the\nbehavior of PDP, we present low-complexity algorithms to compute near-optimal\nARQ distributions for our strategy, and show that our strategy outperforms the\nexisting non-cooperative strategies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Mar 2021 16:24:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-09", "authors_parsed": [["Goel", "Jaya", ""], ["Harshan", "J.", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.04904", "submitter": "Laszlo Csirmaz", "authors": "Laszlo Csirmaz, Franti\\v{s}ek Mat\\'u\\v{s} and Carles Padr\\'o", "title": "Bipartite secret sharing and staircases", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Bipartite secret sharing schemes have a bipartite access structure in which\nthe set of participants is divided into two parts and all participants in the\nsame part play an equivalent role.

Receiver saturation renders\nthe system behavior nonlinear in the number of released NTs and is commonly\nneglected in existing analytical models. Furthermore, due to the ligands'\ncompetition for receptors (and vice versa), the individual binding events at\nthe molecular receiver are in general statistically dependent and the binomial\nmodel for the statistics of the received signal does not apply. In this work,\nwe propose a novel deterministic model for receptor saturation in terms of a\nstate-space description based on an eigenfunction expansion of Fick's diffusion\nequation. The presented solution is numerically stable and computationally\nefficient.

The latter\ntasks require significant amount of time and resources, which may not be\naffordable when the channel is time-varying or the CSI is not accurate enough.\nIn this paper, we consider the uplink between a single-antenna user and a\nmulti-antenna BS and present a novel RIS-empowered Orthogonal Frequency\nDivision Multiplexing (OFDM) communication system based on the differential\nphase shift keying, which is suitable for high noise and/or mobility scenarios.\nConsidering both an idealistic and a realistic channel model, analytical\nexpressions for the Signal-to-Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) and the\nSymbol Error Probability (SEP) of the proposed non-coherent RIS-empowered\nsystem are presented. Our extensive computer simulation results verify the\naccuracy of the presented analysis and showcase the proposed system's\nperformance and superiority over coherent demodulation in different mobility\nand spatial correlation scenarios.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Mar 2021 16:48:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["Chen-Hu", "Kun", ""], ["Alexandropoulos", "George C.", ""], ["Armada", "Ana Garc\u00eda", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.05592", "submitter": "Virgilio Sison", "authors": "Virgilio P.

These codes are common generalizations of the\nwell-studied Folded Reed-Solomon codes and Multiplicity codes, while also\ncapturing the less-studied Additive Folded Reed-Solomon codes as well as a\nlarge family of codes that were not previously known/studied.\n  More significantly our framework also captures the algorithmic\nlist-decodability of the constituent codes. Specifically, we present a unified\nview of the decoding algorithm for ideal theoretic codes and show that the\ndecodability reduces to the analysis of the distance of some related codes. We\nshow that good bounds on this distance lead to capacity-achieving performance\nof the underlying code, providing a unifying explanation of known\ncapacity-achieving results. In the specific case of affine Folded Reed-Solomon\ncodes, our framework shows that they are list-decodable up to capacity (for\nappropriate setting of the parameters), thereby unifying the previous results\nfor Folded Reed-Solomon, Multiplicity and Additive Folded Reed-Solomon codes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 14 Mar 2021 13:58:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-16", "authors_parsed": [["Bhandari", "Siddharth", ""], ["Harsha", "Prahladh", ""], ["Kumar", "Mrinal", ""], ["Sudan", "Madhu", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.08009", "submitter": "Rodrigo de Lamare", "authors": "A.

Then, for the special case of a single-user system, three possible\napproaches are shown in order to optimize the Signal-to-Noise Ratio with\nrespect to the beamformer used at the base station and to the RIS phase shifts.\nNext, for a multiuser system with two cells, assuming channel-matched\nbeamforming, the geometric mean of the downlink Signal-to-Interference plus\nNoise Ratios across users is maximized with respect to the base stations\ntransmit powers and RIS phase shifts configurations. In this scenario, the RIS\nis placed at the cell-edge and some users are jointly served by two base\nstations to increase the system performance. Numerical results show that the\nproposed procedures are effective and that the RIS brings substantial\nperformance improvements to wireless system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 20 Mar 2021 11:51:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-23", "authors_parsed": [["Buzzi", "Stefano", ""], ["D'Andrea", "Carmen", ""], ["Zappone", "Alessio", ""], ["Fresia", "Maria", ""], ["Zhang", "Yong-Ping", ""], ["Feng", "Shulan", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.11167", "submitter": "Ameha Tsegaye Abebe Dr.", "authors": "Ameha Tsegaye Abebe, Chung G.

Thomson's multitaper method is widely used\nin applications, but most of the existing theory is qualitative or asymptotic.\nFurthermore, many practitioners use a DPSS bandwidth $W$ and number of tapers\nthat are smaller than what the theory suggests is optimal because the\ncomputational requirements increase with the number of tapers.

To account for the presence of multiple\ntargets at a given angle, we devise an iterative interference cancellation\nbased orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) procedure, where at each iteration the\ngeneralized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detector is employed to form decision\nstatistics, providing as by-products the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of\nradar channels and CFOs. In the final step, target detection is performed in\ndelay-Doppler domain using target-specific, ICI-decontaminated channel\nestimates over time and frequency, where CFO estimates are utilized to resolve\nDoppler ambiguities, thereby turning ICI from foe to friend. The proposed\nalgorithm can further exploit the ICI effect to introduce an additional\ndimension (namely, CFO) for target resolvability, which enables resolving\ntargets located at the same delay-Doppler-angle cell. Simulation results\nillustrate the ICI exploitation capability of the proposed approach and\nshowcase its superior detection and estimation performance in high-mobility\nscenarios over conventional methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Mar 2021 15:28:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-30", "authors_parsed": [["Keskin", "Musa Furkan", ""], ["Wymeersch", "Henk", ""], ["Koivunen", "Visa", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.15925", "submitter": "Evagoras Stylianou", "authors": "Charalambos D.

As such, there\nhas been broad interest in generalizing the notion to further understand its\nmost basic properties, one of which is the data processing inequality. The\nquantum f-divergence of Petz is one generalization of the quantum relative\nentropy, and it also leads to other relative entropies, such as the Petz--Renyi\nrelative entropies. In this contribution, I introduce the optimized quantum\nf-divergence as a related generalization of quantum relative entropy. I prove\nthat it satisfies the data processing inequality, and the method of proof\nrelies upon the operator Jensen inequality, similar to Petz's original\napproach. Interestingly, the sandwiched Renyi relative entropies are particular\nexamples of the optimized f-divergence. Thus, one benefit of this approach is\nthat there is now a single, unified approach for establishing the data\nprocessing inequality for both the Petz--Renyi and sandwiched Renyi relative\nentropies, for the full range of parameters for which it is known to hold.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Mar 2021 04:15:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Wilde", "Mark M.", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.16814", "submitter": "Sapna Thapar", "authors": "Sapna Thapar, Deepak Mishra, and Ravikant Saini", "title": "Novel Outage-Aware NOMA Protocol for Secrecy Fairness Maximization Among\n  Untrusted Users", "comments": "14 pages, 12 figures", "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, Volume: 69, Issue: 11,\n  Pages: 13259 - 13272, September 2020", "doi": "10.1109/TVT.2020.3022560", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT eess.SP math.IT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Observing the significance of spectrally-efficient secure non-orthogonal\nmultiple access (NOMA), this paper proposes a novel quality of service (QoS)\naware secure NOMA protocol that maximizes secrecy fairness among untrusted\nusers.

To analyze secrecy performance, analytical expressions of SOP for\nboth users are derived, and individual SOP minimization problems are solved\nusing concept of generalized-convexity. High signal-to-noise ratio\napproximation of SOP and asymptotically optimized solution minimizing this\napproximation is also found. Furthermore, a global-optimal solution from\nsecrecy fairness standpoint is obtained at low computational complexity, and\ntight approximation is derived to get analytical insights. Numerical results\npresent useful insights on globally optimized PA which ensure secrecy fairness\nand provide performance gain of about 55.12%, 69.30%, and 19.11%, respectively,\ncompared to fixed PA and individual users' optimal PAs.
