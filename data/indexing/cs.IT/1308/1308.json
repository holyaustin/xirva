Besides cellular-network\nspecific aspects such as BS density, channel fading, average path loss and\ninterference, the model also captures relevant cooperation mechanisms including\nuser-centric BS clustering and channel-dependent cooperation activation. The\nlocations of all BSs are modeled by a Poisson point process. Using tools from\nstochastic geometry, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio\n($\\mathtt{SINR}$) distribution with cooperation is precisely characterized in a\ngenerality-preserving form. The result is then applied to practical design\nproblems of recent interest. We find that increasing the network-wide BS\ndensity improves the $\\mathtt{SINR}$, while the gains increase with the path\nloss exponent. For pilot-based channel estimation, the average spectral\nefficiency saturates at cluster sizes of around $7$ BSs for typical values,\nirrespective of backhaul quality. Finally, it is shown that intra-cluster\nfrequency reuse is favorable in moderately loaded cells with generous\ncooperation activation, while intra-cluster coordinated scheduling may be\nbetter in lightly loaded cells with conservative cooperation activation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Jul 2013 21:11:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 29 Jan 2014 17:21:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 16 Jul 2014 16:50:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-22", "authors_parsed": [["Tanbourgi", "Ralph", ""], ["Singh", "Sarabjot", ""], ["Andrews", "Jeffrey G.", ""], ["Jondral", "Friedrich K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.0047", "submitter": "Nikita Sakhanenko", "authors": "David J.

Information measures, like marginal entropies, mutual and\nmulti-information, have a number of significant advantages over more standard\nstatistical methods, like their reduced sensitivity to sampling limitations\nthan statistical estimates of probability densities. There are also interesting\napplications of these measures to the theory of complexity and to statistical\nmechanics. Their mathematical properties and relationships are therefore of\ninterest at several levels.\n  Of the interesting relationships between common information measures, perhaps\nnone are more intriguing and as elegant as the duality relationships based on\nMobius inversions. These inversions are directly related to the lattices\n(posets) that describe these sets of variables and their multi-variable\nmeasures. In this paper we describe extensions of the duality previously noted\nby Bell to a range of measures, and show how the structure of the lattice\ndetermines fundamental relationships of these functions. Our major result is a\nset of interlinked duality relations among marginal entropies, interaction\ninformation, and conditional interaction information. The implications of these\nresults include a flexible range of alternative formulations of\ninformation-based measures, and a new set of sum rules that arise from\npath-independent sums on the lattice. Our motivation is to advance the\nfundamental integration of this set of ideas and relations, and to show\nexplicitly the ways in which all these measures are interrelated through\nlattice properties.

Moreover, the maximum average performance of a general EH\nnetwork converges to the maximum average performance of the corresponding\nequivalent non-EH network, when $N\\to\\infty$ and $B_{\\rm max}\\to\\infty$.\nAlthough the proposed solution is asymptotic in nature, it is applicable to EH\nsystems transmitting in a large but finite number of time slots and having a\nbattery capacity much larger than the average harvested power and/or the\nmaximum average transmit power.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Aug 2013 12:04:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 17 Nov 2015 00:12:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 30 Jan 2017 22:15:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["Zlatanov", "Nikola", ""], ["Schober", "Robert", ""], ["Hadzi-Velkov", "Zoran", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.2838", "submitter": "Shen Chao", "authors": "Chao Shen and Wei-Chiang Li and Tsung-Hui Chang", "title": "Wireless Information and Energy Transfer in Multi-Antenna Interference\n  Channel", "comments": "13 pages, 10 pt, two columns, 11 figures, submitted to IEEE Trans.\n  Signal Processing", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TSP.2014.2355781", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  This paper considers the transmitter design for wireless information and\nenergy transfer (WIET) in a multiple-input single-output (MISO) interference\nchannel (IFC). The design problem is to maximize the system throughput (i.e.,\nthe weighted sum rate) subject to individual energy harvesting constraints and\npower constraints. Different from the conventional IFCs without energy\nharvesting, the cross-link signals in the considered scenario play two opposite\nroles in information detection (ID) and energy harvesting (EH). It is observed\nthat the ideal scheme, where the receivers can simultaneously perform ID and EH\nfrom the received signal, may not always achieve the best tradeoff between\ninformation transfer and energy harvesting, but simple practical schemes based\non time splitting may perform better. We therefore propose two practical time\nsplitting schemes, namely time division mode switching (TDMS) and time division\nmultiple access (TDMA), in addition to a power splitting (PS) scheme which\nseparates the received signal into two parts for ID and EH, respectively. In\nthe two-user scenario, we show that beamforming is optimal to all the schemes.\nMoreover, the design problems associated with the TDMS and TDMA schemes admit\nsemi-analytical solutions. In the general K-user scenario, a successive convex\napproximation method is proposed to handle the WIET problems associated with\nthe ideal scheme and the PS scheme, which are known to be NP-hard in general.\nThe K-user TDMS and TDMA schemes are shown efficiently solvable as convex\nproblems. Simulation results show that stronger cross-link channel powers\nactually improve the information sum rate under energy harvesting constraints.\nMoreover, none of the schemes under consideration can dominate another in terms\nof the sum rate performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Aug 2013 12:32:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Shen", "Chao", ""], ["Li", "Wei-Chiang", ""], ["Chang", "Tsung-Hui", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.2894", "submitter": "Kai Niu", "authors": "Kai Niu, Kai Chen, Jiaru Lin", "title": "Low-Complexity Sphere Decoding of Polar Codes based on Optimum Path\n  Metric", "comments": "4 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Sphere decoding (SD) of polar codes is an efficient method to achieve the\nerror performance of maximum likelihood (ML) decoding.

Conventional designs are executed in the discrete-time\ndomain, while our design takes account of both the discrete-time and the\ncontinuous-time signals. Namely, our method can take account of the\ncharacteristic of the original analog signal and the influence of the A/D and\nD/A conversion. While the conventional method often indicates that an ideal\ndigital low-pass filter is preferred, we show that the optimal solution need\nnot be an ideal low-pass when the original analog signal is not completely\nband-limited. This fact can not be recognized only in the discrete-time domain.\nMoreover, we consider quantization effects. We discuss the stability and the\nperformance of quantized sampled-data control systems.

Although our results depend\non the mixing forms being random, this imposed structure results in a very\ndifferent type of random projection than those analyzed in the low-rank\nrecovery literature to date.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Aug 2013 14:52:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 25 Oct 2014 01:59:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 15 Dec 2017 17:25:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 12 Jun 2018 09:02:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-13", "authors_parsed": [["Ahmed", "Ali", ""], ["Romberg", "Justin", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.5149", "submitter": "Deborah Cohen", "authors": "Deborah Cohen, and Yonina C.

Opportunistic users could exploit temporarily vacant bands\nafter detecting the absence of activity of their owners. One of the crucial\ntasks in the CR cycle is therefore spectrum sensing and detection which has to\nbe precise and efficient. Yet, CRs typically deal with wideband signals whose\nNyquist rates are very high. In this paper, we propose to reconstruct the power\nspectrum of such signals from sub-Nyquist samples, rather than the signal\nitself as done in previous work, in order to perform detection. We consider\nboth sparse and non sparse signals as well as blind and non blind detection in\nthe sparse case. For each one of those scenarii, we derive the minimal sampling\nrate allowing perfect reconstruction of the signal's power spectrum in a\nnoise-free environment and provide power spectrum recovery techniques that\nachieve those rates. The analysis is performed for two different signal models\nconsidered in the literature, which we refer to as the analog and digital\nmodels, and shows that both lead to similar results.

Cognitive users first\ndetermine the activity of the primary users' through channel sensing and then\ninitiate data transmission at a power level that depends on the channel sensing\ndecisions. It is assumed that finite blocklength codes are employed in the data\ntransmission phase. Hence, errors can occur in reception and retransmissions\ncan be required. Primary users' activities are modeled as a two-state Markov\nchain and an eight-state Markov chain is constructed in order to model the\ncognitive radio channel.

In the absence of CSI at the transmitter, fixed-rate\ntransmission is performed whereas under perfect CSI knowledge, for a given\ntarget error probability, the transmitter varies the rate according to the\nchannel conditions. Under these assumptions, throughput in the presence of\nbuffer constraints is determined by characterizing the maximum constant arrival\nrates that can be supported by the cognitive radio channel while satisfying\ncertain limits on buffer violation probabilities.

It is known that the optimal exponential\nrate at which errors decrease can be achieved by a simple maximum-likelihood\nratio test which does not depend on p or q, but only on the sets P and Q.\n  We consider an adaptive generalization of this model where the choice of p in\nP and q in Q can change in each sample in some way that depends arbitrarily on\nthe previous samples.

The main\nidea is that instead of sending the complete channel matrix each user fixes a\nreceive filter and feeds back a quantized version of the effective channel.\nFinally we underline our findings with simulations for the proposed system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Aug 2013 14:01:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 22 Nov 2013 15:27:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 11 Aug 2014 08:07:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Schreck", "Jan", ""], ["Wunder", "Gerhard", ""], ["Jung", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.6783", "submitter": "Marco Roncaglia", "authors": "Marco Roncaglia, Arianna Montorsi and Marco Genovese", "title": "Bipartite entanglement of quantum states in a pair basis", "comments": "8 pages, 10 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

Here we identify an additional class of quantum states, for\nwhich bipartite entanglement measures can be efficiently computed, providing\nnew rigorous results. Such states are written in arbitrary $d\\times d$\ndimensions, where each basis state in the subsystem A is paired with only one\nstate in B. This new class, that we refer to as pair basis states, is\nremarkably relevant in many physical situations, including quantum optics. We\nfind that negativity is a necessary and sufficient measure of entanglement for\nmixtures of states written in the same pair basis. We also provide analytical\nexpressions for a tight lower-bound estimation of the entanglement of\nformation, a central quantity in quantum information.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Aug 2013 16:06:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Dec 2014 09:38:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Roncaglia", "Marco", ""], ["Montorsi", "Arianna", ""], ["Genovese", "Marco", ""]]}]
