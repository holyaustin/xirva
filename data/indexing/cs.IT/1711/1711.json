The motivation for studying these MC systems is that they can realize\nthe concept of constructive and destructive signal superposition, which leads\nto favorable properties such as inter-symbol interference (ISI) reduction and\navoiding environmental contamination due to continuous release of molecules\ninto the channel. This work first derives the maximum likelihood (ML) detector\nfor a binary MC system with reactive signaling molecules under the assumption\nthat the detector has perfect knowledge of the ISI. The performance of this\ngenie-aided ML detector yields an upper bound on the performance of any\npractical detector. In addition, two suboptimal detectors of different\ncomplexity are proposed.

Accordingly, opening challenges and promising combinations among\ncurrent technologies, such as small-cell, millimeter (mm)-wave, and Internet of\nThings (IoT) networks, are discussed in details to seek solutions for the\nquestion with how to re-green the future networks?\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Nov 2017 20:13:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 8 Mar 2018 22:29:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-12", "authors_parsed": [["Tran", "Ha-Vu", ""], ["Kaddoum", "Georges", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.01339", "submitter": "Marco Mondelli", "authors": "Arman Fazeli, S.

Exploiting recent developments in the theory of\nprobability concentration, we quantify uncertainties by post-processing the\nrecovered MAP estimate. Three strategies to quantify uncertainties are\ndeveloped: (i) highest posterior density credible regions; (ii) local credible\nintervals (cf. error bars) for individual pixels and superpixels; and (iii)\nhypothesis testing of image structure. These forms of uncertainty\nquantification provide rich information for analysing radio interferometric\nobservations in a statistically robust manner. Our MAP-based methods are\napproximately $10^5$ times faster computationally than state-of-the-art MCMC\nmethods and, in addition, support highly distributed and parallelised\nalgorithmic structures. For the first time, our MAP-based techniques provide a\nmeans of quantifying uncertainties for radio interferometric imaging for\nrealistic data volumes and practical use, and scale to the emerging big-data\nera of radio astronomy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 Nov 2017 19:52:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 11 Sep 2018 08:44:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-12", "authors_parsed": [["Cai", "Xiaohao", ""], ["Pereyra", "Marcelo", ""], ["McEwen", "Jason D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.04870", "submitter": "Adam Noel", "authors": "Adam Noel and Yuting Fang and Nan Yang and Dimitrios Makrakis and\n  Andrew W.

In the proposed construction, a common\ninformation set is simply optimized for the highest-rate punctured polar code\nin the family and then, this set is updated for each other code by satisfying\nthe condition that information bits are unchanged during retransmissions. This\nis enabled by presenting a novel hierarchical puncturing and information-copy\ntechnique. To be specific, some information bits are copied to frozen-bit\nchannels, which yields an information-dependent frozen vector. Then, the\nupdated information sets are obtained by appropriately combining the common\ninformation set and an information-dependent frozen vector. Moreover, the\nimpact of unknown frozen bits are resolved using the proposed hierarchical\npuncturing. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RCPP code attains\na significant performance gain (about 2dB) over a benchmark RCPP code where\nboth codes use the same puncturing patterns but the latter uses the\nconventional all-zero frozen vector.

We also give several new\nconstructions of binary LRCs with minimum distance $d = 6$ based on weakly\nindependent sets and partial spreads, which are optimal with respect to our\nnewly obtained bound. In particular, for locality $r\\in \\{2,3\\}$ and minimum\ndistance $d = 6$, we obtain the desired optimal binary linear LRCs with\ndisjoint repair groups for almost all parameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Nov 2017 04:32:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-21", "authors_parsed": [["Ma", "Jingxue", ""], ["Ge", "Gennian", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.07175", "submitter": "Galymzhan Nauryzbayev", "authors": "Galymzhan Nauryzbayev, Emad Alsusa, Mohamed Abdallah", "title": "On the Feasibility of Interference Alignment in Compounded MIMO\n  Broadcast Channels with Antenna Correlation and Mixed User Classes", "comments": "24 pages, 5 figures.

Due to the\nhighly nonconvex nature of the empirical loss, state-of-the-art procedures\noften require proper regularization (e.g. trimming, regularized cost,\nprojection) in order to guarantee fast convergence. For vanilla procedures such\nas gradient descent, however, prior theory either recommends highly\nconservative learning rates to avoid overshooting, or completely lacks\nperformance guarantees.\n  This paper uncovers a striking phenomenon in nonconvex optimization: even in\nthe absence of explicit regularization, gradient descent enforces proper\nregularization implicitly under various statistical models. In fact, gradient\ndescent follows a trajectory staying within a basin that enjoys nice geometry,\nconsisting of points incoherent with the sampling mechanism. This \"implicit\nregularization\" feature allows gradient descent to proceed in a far more\naggressive fashion without overshooting, which in turn results in substantial\ncomputational savings. Focusing on three fundamental statistical estimation\nproblems, i.e. phase retrieval, low-rank matrix completion, and blind\ndeconvolution, we establish that gradient descent achieves near-optimal\nstatistical and computational guarantees without explicit regularization. In\nparticular, by marrying statistical modeling with generic optimization theory,\nwe develop a general recipe for analyzing the trajectories of iterative\nalgorithms via a leave-one-out perturbation argument. As a byproduct, for noisy\nmatrix completion, we demonstrate that gradient descent achieves near-optimal\nerror control --- measured entrywise and by the spectral norm --- which might\nbe of independent interest.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Nov 2017 18:53:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 14 Dec 2017 10:47:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 30 Jul 2019 02:14:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-09", "authors_parsed": [["Ma", "Cong", ""], ["Wang", "Kaizheng", ""], ["Chi", "Yuejie", ""], ["Chen", "Yuxin", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.10538", "submitter": "Ata Khalili", "authors": "Ata Khalili, Soroush Akhlaghi", "title": "Power Control and Scheduling In Low SNR Region In The Uplink of Two Cell\n  Networks", "comments": "Accepted in Journal of Communication Engineering with manuscript ID:\n  JCE-1709-1066 (R1)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.22070/JCE.2018.2810.1066", "report-no": null, "categories": "eess.SP cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we investigate the sub-channel assignment and power control to\nmaximize the total sum rate in the uplink of two-cell network.

In this\npaper, in contrast, we propose a time-domain BA scheme for wideband mmWave\nsystems, where the channel is characterized by multi-path components, different\ndelays, Angle-of-Arrivals/Angle-of-Departures (AoAs/AoDs), and Doppler shifts.\nIn our proposed scheme, the Base Station (BS) probes the channel in the\ndownlink by some sequences with good autocorrelation property (e.g.,\nPseudo-Noise (PN) sequences), letting each user estimate its best AoA-AoD that\nconnects the user to the BS with two-sided high beamforming gain. We leverage\nthe sparse nature of mmWaves in the AoA-AoD-time domain, and formulate the BA\nproblem as a Compressed Sensing (CS) of a non-negative sparse vector. We use\nthe recently developed Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS) technique to\nefficiently find the strongest path connecting the BS and each user. Simulation\nresults show that the proposed scheme outperforms its counterpart in terms of\nthe training overhead and robustness to fast channel variations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Nov 2017 16:36:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Song", "Xiaoshen", ""], ["Haghighatshoar", "Saeid", ""], ["Caire", "Giuseppe", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.11093", "submitter": "Furkan Ercan", "authors": "Furkan Ercan, Carlo Condo, Seyyed Ali Hashemi, Warren J.
