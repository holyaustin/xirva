A critical issue is how the PNC system performs when the\nreceived powers from the two users at the relay are imbalanced. In particular,\nhow would the PNC system perform under slight power imbalance that is\ninevitable in practice, even when power control is applied? To answer these\nquestions, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of q-PAM PNC. Our\ncontributions are as follows: 1) We give a systematic way to obtain the\nanalytical relationship between the minimum distance of the signal\nconstellation induced by the superimposed signals of the two users (a key\nperformance determining factor) and the channel-gain ratio of the two users,\nfor all q. In particular, we show how the minimum distance changes in a\npiecewise linear fashion as the channel-gain ratio varies. 2) We show that the\nperformance of q-PAM PNC is highly sensitive to imbalanced received powers from\nthe two users at the relay, even when the power imbalance is slight (e.g., the\nresidual power imbalance in a power-controlled system). This sensitivity\nproblem is exacerbated as q increases, calling into question the robustness of\nhigh-order modulated PNC. 3) We propose an asynchronized PNC system in which\nthe symbol arrival times of the two users at the relay are deliberately made to\nbe asynchronous. We show that such asynchronized PNC, when operated with a\nbelief propagation (BP) decoder, can remove the sensitivity problem, allowing a\nrobust high-order modulated PNC system to be built.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Nov 2014 06:25:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Shi", "Long", ""], ["Liew", "Soung Chang", ""], ["Lu", "Lu", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.1339", "submitter": "Siddharth Jain", "authors": "Siddharth Jain, R.K.

However Shannon's theory of information does not provide\nformulae to fully determine these quantities. Several recent studies have begun\naddressing this. Some possible definitions for PID quantities have been\nproposed, and some analyses have been carried out on systems composed of\ndiscrete variables. Here we present the first in-depth analysis of PIDs on\nGaussian systems, both static and dynamical. We show that, for a broad class of\nGaussian systems, previously proposed PID formulae imply that: (i) redundancy\nreduces to the minimum information provided by either source variable, and\nhence is independent of correlation between sources; (ii) synergy is the extra\ninformation contributed by the weaker source when the stronger source is known,\nand can either increase or decrease with correlation between sources. We find\nthat Gaussian systems frequently exhibit net synergy, i.e. the information\ncarried jointly by both sources is greater than the sum of informations carried\nby each source individually. Drawing from several explicit examples, we discuss\nthe implications of these findings for measures of information transfer and\ninformation-based measures of complexity, both generally and within a\nneuroscience setting.

Natural communication processes (say between\nhumans) however often involve large amounts of shared correlations among the\ncommunicating players, but rarely allow for perfect sharing of randomness. Can\nthe communication complexity benefit from shared correlations as well as it\ndoes from shared randomness? This question was considered mainly in the context\nof simultaneous communication by Bavarian et al. (ICALP 2014). In this work we\nstudy this problem in the standard interactive setting and give some general\nresults. In particular, we show that every problem with communication\ncomplexity of $k$ bits with perfectly shared randomness has a protocol using\nimperfectly shared randomness with complexity $\\exp(k)$ bits. We also show that\nthis is best possible by exhibiting a promise problem with complexity $k$ bits\nwith perfectly shared randomness which requires $\\exp(k)$ bits when the\nrandomness is imperfectly shared. Along the way we also highlight some other\nbasic problems such as compression, and agreement distillation, where shared\nrandomness plays a central role and analyze the complexity of these problems in\nthe imperfectly shared randomness model.\n  The technical highlight of this work is the lower bound that goes into the\nresult showing the tightness of our general connection. This result builds on\nthe intuition that communication with imperfectly shared randomness needs to be\nless sensitive to its random inputs than communication with perfectly shared\nrandomness.

We demonstrate that for natural\ncompressed sensing matrices involving a level based reconstruction basis (e.g.\nwavelets), the number of measurements required to recover all $s$-sparse\nsignals for reasonable $s$ is excessive. In particular, uniform recovery of all\n$s$-sparse signals is quite unrealistic.

Each synthesized channel corresponds to a particular\ninput to the encoder. For large $n$, the synthesized channels become either\nessentially noiseless or almost perfectly noisy, but in total carry as much\ninformation as the original $n$ channels. Capacity can therefore be achieved by\ntransmitting messages over the essentially noiseless synthesized channels.\nUnfortunately, the set of inputs corresponding to reliable synthesized channels\nis poorly understood, in particular how the set depends on the underlying\nphysical channel. In this work, we present two analytic conditions sufficient\nto determine if the reliable inputs corresponding to different discrete\nmemoryless channels are aligned or not, i.e. if one set is contained in the\nother. Understanding the alignment of the polarized sets is important as it is\ndirectly related to universality properties of the induced polar codes, which\nare essential in particular for network coding problems. We demonstrate the\nperformance of our conditions on a few examples for wiretap and broadcast\nchannels. Finally we show that these conditions imply that the simple quantum\npolar coding scheme of Renes et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 050504 (2012)]\nrequires entanglement assistance for general channels, but also show such\nassistance to be unnecessary in many cases of interest.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Nov 2014 16:07:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-22", "authors_parsed": [["Renes", "Joseph M.", ""], ["Sutter", "David", ""], ["Hassani", "S.
