In the deterministic channel problem,\nwe find the constrained sum-capacity and its achievable schemes with the\nminimum number of messages, first in symmetric channels, and then in general\nasymmetric channels. We show that the constrained sum-capacity oscillates as a\nfunction of the cross link gain parameters between the information theoretic\nsum-capacity and the sum-capacity with interference treated as noise.\nFurthermore, we show that if the number of messages of either of the two users\nis fewer than the minimum number required to achieve the constrained\nsum-capacity, the maximum achievable sum-rate drops to that with interference\ntreated as noise. We provide two algorithms (a simple one and a finer one) to\ntranslate the optimal schemes in the deterministic channel model to the\nGaussian channel model. We also derive two upper bounds on the sum-capacity of\nthe Gaussian Han-Kobayashi schemes, which automatically upper bound the\nsum-capacity using successive decoding of Gaussian codewords.

In the network,\nwe characterize an attenuation parameter that depends on the frequency scaling\nas well as the transmission distance. Cut-set upper bounds on the throughput\nscaling are then derived in both extended and dense networks having unit node\ndensity and unit area, respectively.

Furthermore, we show that the high\nSNR slope is characterized by a pre-log of 1-2f_d, where f_d is the normalized\nmaximum Doppler frequency. This pre-log is equal to the high SNR pre-log of the\npeak power constrained capacity.

Our optimization criteria are the average electrical and optical\npower. The nonnegativity input signal constraint is translated into a conical\nconstraint in signal space, and modulation formats are designed by sphere\npacking inside this cone. Some remarkably dense packings are found, which yield\nmore power-efficient modulation formats than previously known. For example, at\na spectral efficiency of 1 bit/s/Hz, the obtained modulation format offers a\n0.86 dB average electrical power gain and 0.43 dB average optical power gain\nover the previously best known modulation formats to achieve a symbol error\nrate of 10^-6. This modulation turns out to have a lattice-based structure. At\na spectral efficiency of 3/2 bits/s/Hz and to achieve a symbol error rate of\n10^-6, the modulation format obtained for optimizing the average electrical\npower offers a 0.58 dB average electrical power gain over the best\nlattice-based modulation and 2.55 dB gain over the best previously known\nformat. However, the modulation format optimized for average optical power\noffers a 0.46 dB average optical power gain over the best lattice-based\nmodulation and 1.35 dB gain over the best previously known format.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 12 Mar 2011 00:17:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Karout", "Johnny", ""], ["Agrell", "Erik", ""], ["Szczerba", "Krzysztof", ""], ["Karlsson", "Magnus", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.3292", "submitter": "Hsuan-Jung Su", "authors": "Jin-Hao Li and Hsuan-Jung Su", "title": "Feedback Reduction for MIMO Broadcast Channel with Heterogeneous Fading", "comments": "6 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper considers feedback load reduction for multiuser multiple input\nmultiple output (MIMO) broadcast channel where the users' channel distributions\nare not homogeneous.

In this setting,\nthe probability of error is a function of the dimension of the problem. A\nsimple sequential testing procedure is proposed. We derive necessary conditions\nfor reliable recovery in the non-sequential setting and contrast them with\nsufficient conditions for reliable recovery using the proposed sequential\ntesting procedure. Applications of the main results to several commonly\nencountered models show that sequential testing can be exponentially more\nsensitive to the difference between the null and alternative distributions (in\nterms of the dependence on dimension), implying that subtle cases can be much\nmore reliably determined using sequential methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Mar 2011 16:56:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 3 Jun 2011 18:52:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Malloy", "Matthew", ""], ["Nowak", "Robert", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.6060", "submitter": "Chenwei Wang", "authors": "Chenwei Wang, Syed A.
