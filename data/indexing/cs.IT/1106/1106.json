We consider two objectives: maximizing the throughput by a\ndeadline, and minimizing the transmission completion time of the communication\nsession. We optimize these objectives by controlling the time sequence of\ntransmit powers subject to energy storage capacity and causality constraints.\nWe, first, study optimal offline policies. We introduce a directional\nwater-filling algorithm which provides a simple and concise interpretation of\nthe necessary optimality conditions. We show the optimality of an adaptive\ndirectional water-filling algorithm for the throughput maximization problem. We\nsolve the transmission completion time minimization problem by utilizing its\nequivalence to its throughput maximization counterpart. Next, we consider\nonline policies. We use stochastic dynamic programming to solve for the optimal\nonline policy that maximizes the average number of bits delivered by a deadline\nunder stochastic fading and energy arrival processes with causal channel state\nfeedback. We also propose near-optimal policies with reduced complexity, and\nnumerically study their performances along with the performances of the offline\nand online optimal policies under various different configurations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Jun 2011 16:31:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-09", "authors_parsed": [["Ozel", "Omur", ""], ["Tutuncuoglu", "Kaya", ""], ["Yang", "Jing", ""], ["Ulukus", "Sennur", ""], ["Yener", "Aylin", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.1634", "submitter": "Dimitris S.

Up until now, little basic research has been done on the\nfundamentals of managing so much infrastructure -- much of it unplanned --\ntogether with the carefully planned macro-cellular network. Inter-cell\ncoordination is in principle an effective way of ensuring different\ninfrastructure components behave in a way that increases, rather than\ndecreases, the key quality of service (QoS) metrics. The success of such\ncoordination depends heavily on how the overhead is shared, and the rate and\ndelay of the overhead sharing. We develop a novel framework to quantify\noverhead signaling for inter-cell coordination, which is usually ignored in\ntraditional 1-tier networks, and assumes even more importance in multi-tier\nheterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs). We derive the overhead quality contour\nfor general K-tier HCNs -- the achievable set of overhead packet rate, size,\ndelay and outage probability -- in closed-form expressions or computable\nintegrals under general assumptions on overhead arrivals and different overhead\nsignaling methods (backhaul and/or wireless). The overhead quality contour is\nfurther simplified for two widely used models of overhead arrivals: Poisson and\ndeterministic arrival process.

It is undecided if there\nexists a code C for which the improved bound can beat the asymptotic GV bound.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jun 2011 12:32:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Tolhuizen", "Ludo", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.6224", "submitter": "Marco Duarte", "authors": "Marco F.

Previous review articles in CS limit\ntheir scope to standard discrete-to-discrete measurement architectures using\nmatrices of randomized nature and signal models based on standard sparsity. In\nrecent years, CS has worked its way into several new application areas. This,\nin turn, necessitates a fresh look on many of the basics of CS. The random\nmatrix measurement operator must be replaced by more structured sensing\narchitectures that correspond to the characteristics of feasible acquisition\nhardware. The standard sparsity prior has to be extended to include a much\nricher class of signals and to encode broader data models, including\ncontinuous-time signals. In our overview, the theme is exploiting signal and\nmeasurement structure in compressive sensing. The prime focus is bridging\ntheory and practice; that is, to pinpoint the potential of structured CS\nstrategies to emerge from the math to the hardware. Our summary highlights new\ndirections as well as relations to more traditional CS, with the hope of\nserving both as a review to practitioners wanting to join this emerging field,\nand as a reference for researchers that attempts to put some of the existing\nideas in perspective of practical applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jun 2011 13:38:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 28 Jul 2011 05:43:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Duarte", "Marco F.", ""], ["Eldar", "Yonina C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.6271", "submitter": "Sayed.

In this most general case, the diversity-multiplexing\ntradeoff is characterized as a solution to a simple, two-variable optimization\nproblem. This problem is then solved in closed form for special classes of\nchannels defined by certain restrictions on the numbers of antennas at the\nthree nodes. The key mathematical tool developed here that enables the explicit\ncharacterization of the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff is the joint eigenvalue\ndistribution of three mutually correlated random Wishart matrices. Previously,\nwithout actually characterizing the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff, the\noptimality in this tradeoff metric of the dynamic compress-and-forward (DCF)\nprotocol based on the classical compress-and-forward scheme of Cover and El\nGamal was shown by Yuksel and Erkip. However, this scheme requires global\nchannel state information (CSI) at the relay. In this work, the so-called\nquantize-map and forward (QMF) coding scheme due to Avestimehr {\\em et} {\\em\nal} is adopted as the achievability scheme with the added benefit that it\nachieves optimal tradeoff with only the knowledge of the (channel dependent)\nswitching time at the relay node. Moreover, in special classes of the MIMO\nhalf-duplex relay channel, the optimal tradeoff is shown to be attainable even\nwithout this knowledge. Such a result was previously known only for the\nhalf-duplex relay channel with a single antenna at each node, also via the QMF\nscheme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jun 2011 18:16:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Karmakar", "Sanjay", ""], ["Varanasi", "Mahesh K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.6328", "submitter": "Jeong-woo Cho", "authors": "Jeong-woo Cho, Jean-Yves Le Boudec, Yuming Jiang", "title": "On the Asymptotic Validity of the Decoupling Assumption for Analyzing\n  802.11 MAC Protocol", "comments": "16 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on\n  Information Theory", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TIT.2012.2208582", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.IT cs.PF math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Performance evaluation of the 802.11 MAC protocol is classically based on the\ndecoupling assumption, which hypothesizes that the backoff processes at\ndifferent nodes are independent. This decoupling assumption results from mean\nfield convergence and is generally true in transient regime in the asymptotic\nsense (when the number of wireless nodes tends to infinity), but, contrary to\nwidespread belief, may not necessarily hold in stationary regime. The issue is\noften related with the existence and uniqueness of a solution to a fixed point\nequation; however, it was also recently shown that this condition is not\nsufficient; in contrast, a sufficient condition is a global stability property\nof the associated ordinary differential equation. In this paper, we give a\nsimple condition that establishes the asymptotic validity of the decoupling\nassumption for the homogeneous case. We also discuss the heterogeneous and the\ndifferentiated service cases and formulate a new ordinary differential\nequation. We show that the uniqueness of a solution to the associated fixed\npoint equation is not sufficient; we exhibit one case where the fixed point\nequation has a unique solution but the decoupling assumption is not valid in\nthe asymptotic sense in stationary regime.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jun 2011 18:29:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 26 Jun 2012 19:04:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 00:20:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Cho", "Jeong-woo", ""], ["Boudec", "Jean-Yves Le", ""], ["Jiang", "Yuming", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.6335", "submitter": "Francesco Noseda", "authors": "Francesco Noseda, Gilvan Oliveira, Luciane Quoos", "title": "Bases for Riemann-Roch spaces of one point divisors on an optimal tower\n  of function fields", "comments": "15 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NT cs.IT math.AG math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  For applications in algebraic geometric codes, an explicit description of\nbases of Riemann-Roch spaces of divisors on function fields over finite fields\nis needed.
