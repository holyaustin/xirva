When the direct\npacket transmission fails, the relay replaces the source and retransmits the\npacket until it is eventually obtained at the receiver side. Assume that the\npropagation delay on each link is one time slot, we determine the stationary\ndistribution of the AoI for three cases: (a) relay has no buffer and the packet\ndelivery from relay cannot be preempted by fresher updates from source; (b)\nrelay has no buffer but the packet substitution is allowable; (c) relay has\nsize 1 buffer and the packet in buffer is refreshed when a newer packet is\nobtained. The idea is invoking a multiple-dimensional state vector which\ncontains the AoI as a part and constituting the multiple-dimensional AoI\nstochastic process. We find the steady state of each multiple-dimensional AoI\nprocess by solving the system of stationary equations. Once the steady-state\ndistribution of larger-dimensional AoI process is known, the stationary AoI\ndistribution is also obtained as it is one of the marginal distributions of\nthat process's steady-state distribution.

Let us call these two variables the causal and caused\nvariables, respectively. We assume that both of these random variables are\ncontinuous and one-dimensional. Carrying out independent transformations on the\ncausal and caused variable creates two new random variables. Here, we consider\ntransformations that are differentiable and strictly increasing. We call these\nincreasing transformations. If, for example, the mass of an object is a caused\nvariable, a logarithmic transformation could be applied to produce a new caused\nvariable. Any causal relationship (as defined here) is associated with a\nchannel capacity, which is the maximum rate that information could be sent if\nthe causal relationship was used as a signalling system. Channel capacity is\nunaffected when the variables are changed by use of increasing transformations.\nFor any causal relationship we show that there is always a way to transform the\ncaused variable such that the entropy associated with the caused variable is\nindependent of the value of the causal variable. Furthermore, the resulting\nuniversal entropy has an absolute value that is equal to the channel capacity\nassociated with the causal relationship. This observation may be useful in\nstatistical applications, and it implies that, for any causal relationship,\nthere is a `natural' way to transform a continuous caused variable.

To reduce the\nchannel training overhead, we advocate a novel protocol for the uplink\ncommunication in the IRS-assisted massive MIMO systems. Under this protocol,\nthe IRS reflection coefficients are optimized based on the channel covariance\nmatrices, which are generally fixed for many coherence blocks, to boost the\nlong-term performance. Then, given the IRS reflecting coefficients, the BS\nbeamforming vectors are designed in each coherence block based on the effective\nchannel of each user, which is the superposition of its direct and reflected\nuser-IRS-BS channels, to improve the instantaneous performance. Since merely\nthe user effective channels are estimated in each coherence block, the training\noverhead of this protocol is the same as that in the legacy wireless systems\nwithout IRSs. Moreover, in the asymptotic regime that the numbers of IRS\nelements and BS antennas both go to infinity with a fixed ratio, we manage to\nfirst characterize the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimators of the user\neffective channels and then quantify the closed-form user achievable rates as\nfunctions of channel covariance matrices with channel training overhead and\nestimation error taken into account.

Multiple packing is a natural generalization of sphere packing and is\ndefined as follows. Let $ N>0 $ and $ L\\in\\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge2} $. A multiple\npacking is a set $\\mathcal{C}$ of points in $ \\mathbb{R}^n $ such that any\npoint in $ \\mathbb{R}^n $ lies in the intersection of at most $ L-1 $ balls of\nradius $ \\sqrt{nN} $ around points in $ \\mathcal{C} $. We study the multiple\npacking problem for both bounded point sets whose points have norm at most\n$\\sqrt{nP}$ for some constant $P>0$ and unbounded point sets whose points are\nallowed to be anywhere in $ \\mathbb{R}^n $. Given a well-known connection with\ncoding theory, multiple packings can be viewed as the Euclidean analog of\nlist-decodable codes, which are well-studied for finite fields. In this paper,\nwe derive various bounds on the largest possible density of a multiple packing\nin both bounded and unbounded settings. A related notion called average-radius\nmultiple packing is also studied. Some of our lower bounds exactly pin down the\nasymptotics of certain ensembles of average-radius list-decodable codes, e.g.,\n(expurgated) Gaussian codes and (expurgated) Poisson Point Processes. To this\nend, we apply tools from high-dimensional geometry and large deviation theory.\nSome of our lower bounds on the optimal multiple packing density are the best\nknown lower bounds. These bounds are obtained via a proxy known as error\nexponent. The latter quantity is the best exponent of the probability of\nlist-decoding error when the code is corrupted by a Gaussian noise. We\nestablish a curious inequality which relates the error exponent, a quantity of\naverage-case nature, to the list-decoding radius, a quantity of worst-case\nnature. We derive various bounds on the error exponent in both bounded and\nunbounded settings which are of independent interest beyond multiple packing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 12 Jul 2021 01:49:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Yihan", ""], ["Vatedka", "Shashank", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.05174", "submitter": "Jihao Fan", "authors": "Jihao Fan, Jun Li, Ya Wang, Yonghui Li, Min-Hsiu Hsieh, and Jiangfeng\n  Du", "title": "From Generalization of Bacon-Shor Codes to High Performance Quantum LDPC\n  Codes", "comments": "22 pages,2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  We utilize a concatenation scheme to construct new families of quantum error\ncorrection codes that include the Bacon-Shor codes.

We study the average AoI with and without ARQ in\nPNC-enabled TWRNs. We first consider a non-ARQ scheme where old packets are\nalways dropped when corrupted, referred to once-lost-then-drop (OLTD), and a\nclassical ARQ scheme with no packet lost, referred to as reliable packet\ntransmission (RPT). Interestingly, our analysis shows that neither the non-ARQ\nscheme nor the pure ARQ scheme achieves good average AoI. We then put forth an\nuplink-lost-then-drop (ULTD) protocol that combines packet drop and ARQ.\nExperiments on software-defined radio indicate that ULTD significantly\noutperforms OLTD and RPT in terms of average AoI. Although this paper focuses\non TWRNs, we believe the insight of ULTD applies generally to other two-hop\nnetworks. Our insight is that to achieve high information freshness, when\npackets are corrupted in the first hop, new packets should be generated and\nsent (i.e., old packets are discarded); when packets are corrupted in the\nsecond hop, old packets should be retransmitted until successful reception.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 14 Jul 2021 08:07:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Pan", "Haoyuan", ""], ["Chan", "Tse-Tin", ""], ["Leung", "Victor C.

Targeting the sixth-generation (6G)\nhorizon, we anticipate the integration of RISs into BackCom systems as a new\nfrontier for enabling 6G IoT networks. In this article, for the first time in\nthe open literature, we provide a tutorial overview of RIS-assisted BackCom\n(RIS-BackCom) systems. Specifically, we introduce the four different variants\nof RIS-BackCom and identify the potential improvements that can be achieved by\nincorporating RISs into BackCom systems. In addition, owing to the unrivaled\neffectiveness of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), we present a case study\non an RIS-assisted NOMA-enhanced BackCom system. Finally, we outline the way\nforward for translating this disruptive concept into real-world applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 16 Jul 2021 10:42:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Basharat", "Sarah", ""], ["Hassan", "Syed Ali", ""], ["Mahmood", "Aamir", ""], ["Ding", "Zhiguo", ""], ["Gidlund", "Mikael", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.07846", "submitter": "Rafail Ismayilov", "authors": "Rafail Ismayilov, Renato L.

Furthermore, our theoretical results demonstrate that, in contrast\nto the existing single-layer structure, where only the phase of the signal\nreflected from RIS can be adjusted, the amplitude of the signal penetrating\nmulti-layer US-RIS can also be partially controlled, which brings about a new\ndegree of freedom (DoF) for beamformer design that can be beneficially\nexploited for performance enhancement.

Specifically,\neach agent modulates its local gradient onto a set of waveforms and transmits\nto the edge server simultaneously. From the received analog signal the edge\nserver extracts a noisy aggregated gradient which is distorted by the channel\nfading and interference, and uses it to update the global model and feedbacks\nto all the agents for another round of local computing.

Next, to compute the effective capacity (EC) for the given D2D link,\nwe assume that the channel state information (CSI) is not available at the\ntransmit D2D node, and hence, it transmits at a fixed rate r with a fixed\npower. This allows us to model the D2D link as a Markov system with six-states.\nWe consider both overlay and underlay modes for the D2D link.

However, existing bounds are often loose and lack of\nguarantees. As a result, they may fail to characterize the exact generalization\nability of a learning algorithm. Our main contribution is an exact\ncharacterization of the expected generalization error of the well-known Gibbs\nalgorithm in terms of symmetrized KL information between the input training\nsamples and the output hypothesis. Such a result can be applied to tighten\nexisting expected generalization error bound. Our analysis provides more\ninsight on the fundamental role the symmetrized KL information plays in\ncontrolling the generalization error of the Gibbs algorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Jul 2021 22:20:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Aminian", "Gholamali", ""], ["Bu", "Yuheng", ""], ["Toni", "Laura", ""], ["Rodrigues", "Miguel R.

Relative\nto such models, sky-to-ground cellular channels will exhibit less diffraction,\ndeeper shadowing, larger Doppler shifts, and possibly far stronger cross-cell\ninterference: consequences of high elevation angles and extreme \"sectorization\"\nof LEO satellite transmissions into partially-overlapping spot beams. To permit\nforecasting of expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), interference-to-noise\nratio (INR) and probability of outage, we characterize the powers of desired\nand interference signals as received by ground users from such a LEO satellite.\nIn particular, building on the Shadowed Rician channel model, we observe that\nco-cell and cross-cell sky-to-ground signals travel along similar paths,\nwhereas terrestrial co- and cross-cell signals travel along very different\npaths. We characterize SNR, signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), and INR using\ntransmit beam profiles and linear relationships that we establish between\ncertain Shadowed Rician random variables. These tools allow us to simplify\ncertain density functions and moments, facilitating future analysis. Numerical\nresults yield insight into the key question of whether emerging LEO systems\nshould be viewed as interference- or noise-limited.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Jul 2021 07:03:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Eunsun", ""], ["Roberts", "Ian P.", ""], ["Iannucci", "Peter A.", ""], ["Andrews", "Jeffrey G.", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.13838", "submitter": "Linlong Wu", "authors": "Linlong Wu, Kumar Vijay Mishra, Bhavani Shankar M.

All these messages are intended for the\nlegitimate receiver (or Bob for brevity) but only the confidential messages\nneed to be protected from the eavesdropper (Eve). We first consider a discrete\nmemoryless (DM) MAC-WT channel where both Bob and Eve jointly decode their\ninterested messages. By using random coding, we find an achievable rate region,\nwithin which perfect secrecy can be realized, i.e., all users can communicate\nwith Bob with arbitrarily small probability of error, while the confidential\ninformation leaked to Eve tends to zero. Due to the high implementation\ncomplexity of joint decoding, we also consider the DM MAC-WT channel where Bob\nsimply decodes messages independently while Eve still applies joint decoding.\nWe then extend the results in the DM case to a Gaussian vector (GV) MAC-WT\nchannel. Based on the information theoretic results, we further maximize the\nsum secrecy rate of the GV MAC-WT system by designing precoders for all users.\nSince the problems are non-convex, we provide iterative algorithms to obtain\nsuboptimal solutions. Simulation results show that compared with existing\nschemes, secure communication can be greatly enhanced by the proposed\nalgorithms, and in contrast to the works which only focus on the network\nsecrecy performance, the system spectrum efficiency can be effectively improved\nsince open messages can be simultaneously transmitted.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Jul 2021 16:38:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Hao", ""], ["Yang", "Tianyu", ""], ["Wong", "Kai-Kit", ""], ["Caire", "Giuseppe", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.14218", "submitter": "Melih Bastopcu", "authors": "Melih Bastopcu and Baturalp Buyukates and Sennur Ulukus", "title": "Gossiping with Binary Freshness Metric", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.NI eess.SP math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the binary freshness metric for gossip networks that consist of a\nsingle source and $n$ end-nodes, where the end-nodes are allowed to share their\nstored versions of the source information with the other nodes.
