This generates an $R$-regular graph structure for the\nstorage system where the vertices of the graph are the messages and the edges\nare the databases. We derive a general upper bound for $M=2$ that depends on\nthe graph structure. We then specialize the problem to storage systems\ndescribed by two special types of graph structures: cyclic graphs and\n\\emph{fully-connected graphs}. We prove that the PIR capacity for the case of\ncyclic graphs is $\\frac{2}{K+1}$, and the PIR capacity for the case of\nfully-connected graphs is $\\min\\{\\frac{2}{K},\\frac{1}{2}\\}$. To that end, we\npropose novel achievable schemes for both graph structures that are\ncapacity-achieving. The central insight in both schemes is to introduce\ndependency in the queries submitted to databases that do not contain the\ndesired message, such that the requests can be compressed. In both cases, the\nresults show severe degradation in PIR capacity due to non-replication.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Dec 2018 18:52:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Banawan", "Karim", ""], ["Ulukus", "Sennur", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.00040", "submitter": "Alireza Sedghi", "authors": "Alireza Sedghi, Jie Luo, Alireza Mehrtash, Steve Pieper, Clare M.\n  Tempany, Tina Kapur, Parvin Mousavi, William M.

These services are fueled by emerging\napplications that require rapidly injecting data streams and computing updated\nanalytics results in real-time. In many of such applications, the computing\nresources are often shared for processing both updates from information sources\nand queries from end users. This requires joint scheduling of updates and\nqueries because the service provider needs to make a critical decision upon\nreceiving a user query: either it responds immediately with currently available\nbut possibly stale information, or it first processes new updates and then\nresponds with fresher information. Hence, the tradeoff between service\nperformance and information freshness naturally arises in this context. To that\nend, we propose a simple single-server two-queue model that captures the\ncoupled scheduling of updates and queries and aim to design scheduling policies\nthat can properly address the important tradeoff between performance and\nfreshness. Specifically, we consider the response time as a performance metric\nand the Age of Information (AoI) as a freshness metric. After demonstrating the\nlimitations of the simplest FCFS policy, we propose two threshold-based\npolicies: the Query-k policy that prioritizes queries and the Update-k policy\nthat prioritizes updates. Then, we rigorously analyze both the response time\nand the Peak AoI (PAoI) of the threshold-based policies. Further, we propose\nthe Joint-(M,N) policy, which allows flexibly prioritizing updates or queries\nthrough choosing different values of two thresholds M and N. Finally, we\nconduct simulations to evaluate the response time and the PAoI of the proposed\npolicies.

In this paper, we study the effect of introducing redundancy,\nin the form of coded packets, into a probabilistic forwarding protocol.\nSpecifically, we assume that the source node has $k$ data packets to broadcast,\nwhich are encoded into $n \\ge k$ coded packets, such that any $k$ of these\ncoded packets are sufficient to recover the original $k$ data packets.

In this\ncontext, an energy-efficient scheduling algorithm for timely information\ndownloads is critical, especially for power-limited mobile devices. Moreover,\nunpredictable movement of the mobile device causes uncertainty of the channel\ndynamics, which is even non-stationary within a finite amount of time for\nrunning the application. Thus, in this paper we devise a randomized online\nscheduling algorithm for mobile devices, which can move arbitrarily and run the\napplication for any amount of time. We show that the expected total cost\nincurred by the proposed algorithm, including an age cost and a downloading\ncost, is (asymptotically) at most e/(e-1) ~ 1.58 times the minimum total cost\nachieved by an optimal offline scheduling algorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Jan 2019 13:05:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 13 Jan 2019 14:22:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 16 Jan 2019 10:09:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 29 Apr 2019 01:18:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 30 Apr 2019 08:58:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Tseng", "Yi-Hsuan", ""], ["Hsu", "Yu-Pin", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.03142", "submitter": "Yaqian Zhang", "authors": "Yaqian Zhang, Zhifang Zhang", "title": "An Improved Cooperative Repair Scheme for Reed-Solomon Codes", "comments": "submitted to ISIT2019", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Dau et al. recently extend Guruswami and Wootters' scheme (STOC'2016) to\ncooperatively repair two or three erasures in Reed-Solomon (RS) codes.

A close relative of\ninterferometric inversion is the generalized phase retrieval problem, which\nconsists of recovering a signal from the auto-correlations of its linear\ntransformations. Recently, significant advancements have been made in phase\nretrieval methods despite the ill-posed, and non-convex nature of the problem.\nOne such method is Wirtinger Flow (WF), a non-convex optimization framework\nthat provides high probability guarantees of exact recovery under certain\nmeasurement models, such as coded diffraction patterns, and Gaussian sampling\nvectors.

GWF theory\nextends the probabilistic exact recovery results of WF to arbitrary measurement\nmodels characterized in the equivalent lifted problem, hence covers a larger\nclass of measurement models. Our framework unifies the theory of low rank\nmatrix recovery (LRMR) and the non-convex optimization approach of WF, thereby\nestablishes theoretical advantages of the non-convex approach over LRMR. We\nidentify a new sufficient condition on the lifted forward model that directly\nimplies exact recovery conditions of standard WF.

To tackle this\ndifficulty, we first approximate the parameter by a logistic ('S' shape)\nfunction with respect to the 3D UAV trajectory by using the data regression\nmethod. Then the original problem is reformulated to an approximate form,\nwhich, however, is still challenging to solve due to its non-convexity. As\nsuch, we further propose an efficient algorithm to derive its suboptimal\nsolution by using the block coordinate descent technique, which iteratively\noptimizes the communication scheduling, the UAV's horizontal trajectory, and\nits vertical trajectory. The latter two subproblems are shown to be non-convex,\nwhile locally optimal solutions are obtained for them by using the successive\nconvex approximation technique. Last, extensive numerical results are provided\nto evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and draw new insights on\nthe 3D UAV trajectory under the Rician fading as compared to conventional LoS\nchannel models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Jan 2019 01:52:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 5 Mar 2019 01:11:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 1 Apr 2019 13:33:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 17 Apr 2019 02:01:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 8 May 2019 15:07:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-09", "authors_parsed": [["You", "Changsheng", ""], ["Zhang", "Rui", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.04119", "submitter": "Yourui Huangfu", "authors": "Yourui Huangfu, Jian Wang, Rong Li, Chen Xu, Xianbin Wang, Huazi\n  Zhang, Jun Wang", "title": "Predicting the Mumble of Wireless Channel with Sequence-to-Sequence\n  Models", "comments": "7 pages, 7 figures, updated figure 6&7, added references", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "eess.SP cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Accurate prediction of fading channel in the upcoming transmission frame is\nessential to realize adaptive transmission for transmitters, and receivers with\nthe ability of channel prediction can also save some computations of channel\nestimation.

The goal\nis to determine entangling abilities of such arbitrary bipartite quantum\ninteractions. Doing so provides fundamental limitations on information\nprocessing tasks, including entanglement distillation and secret key\ngeneration, over a bipartite quantum network. We also discuss limitations on\nthe entropy change and its rate for dynamics of an open quantum system weakly\ninteracting with the bath. We introduce a measure of non-unitarity to\ncharacterize the deviation of a doubly stochastic quantum process from a\nnoiseless evolution.\n  Next, we introduce information processing tasks for secure read-out of\ndigital information encoded in read-only memory devices against adversaries of\nvarying capabilities. The task of reading a memory device involves the\nidentification of an interaction process between probe system, which is in\nknown state, and the memory device. Essentially, the information is stored in\nthe choice of channels, which are noisy quantum processes in general and are\nchosen from a publicly known set. Hence, it becomes pertinent to securely read\nmemory devices against scrutiny of an adversary. In particular, for a secure\nread-out task called private reading when a reader is under surveillance of a\npassive eavesdropper, we have determined upper bounds on its performance.

Several research works have\nsuccessfully designed optimal sampling and/or control strategies under\nsimplified communication models, where transmission delays/times are negligible\nor fixed. However, considering sophisticated communication models, with random\ntransmission times, result in highly coupled and difficult-to-solve optimal\ndesign problems due to the parameter inter-dependencies between\nestimation/control and communication layers. To tackle this problem, in this\nwork, we investigate the applicability of Age-of-Information (AoI) for solving\ncontrol/estimation problems in an NCS under i.i.d. transmission times. Our\nmotivation for this investigation stems from the following facts: 1) recent\nresults indicate that AoI can be tackled under relatively sophisticated\ncommunication models, and 2) a lower AoI in an NCS may result in a lower\nestimation/control cost. We study a joint optimization of sampling and\nscheduling for a single-loop stochastic LTI networked system with the objective\nof minimizing the time-average squared norm of the estimation error. We first\nshow that under mild assumptions on information structure the optimal control\npolicy can be designed independently from the sampling and scheduling policies.\nWe then derive a key result that minimizing the estimation error is equivalent\nto minimizing a function of AoI when the sampling decisions are independent of\nthe state of the LTI system.

Simulation results show that the proposed SC-Fano\ndecoding significantly enhances the performance of SC decoding with a similar\ncomplexity as well as achieves the performance of SCL decoding with a lower\ncomplexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Jan 2019 04:49:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-24", "authors_parsed": [["Jeong", "Min-Oh", ""], ["Hong", "Song-Nam", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.06795", "submitter": "Dhruva Kartik", "authors": "Dhruva Kartik, Ashutosh Nayyar, Urbashi Mitra", "title": "Active Hypothesis Testing: Beyond Chernoff-Stein", "comments": "Submitted to 2019 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory\n  (ISIT)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An active hypothesis testing problem is formulated.

In a real-world\nIoT, due to the possibly different dynamics of each physical process, the sizes\nof the status updates for different devices are often different and each status\nupdate typically requires multiple transmission slots. By taking into account\nsuch multi-time slot transmissions with non-uniform sizes of the status updates\nunder noisy channels, the problem of joint device scheduling and status\nsampling is studied in order to minimize the average age of information (AoI)\nat the destination. This stochastic problem is formulated as an infinite\nhorizon average cost Markov decision process (MDP). The monotonicity of the\nvalue function of the MDP is characterized and then used to show that the\noptimal scheduling and sampling policy is threshold-based with respect to the\nAoI at each device.

For protecting the privacy of users, we\nintroduce the notion of individual-privacy -- the agent is required to protect\nthe privacy only for each individual user (but may leak some correlations among\nuser requests). We refer to this problem as Individually-Private Information\nRetrieval with Side Information (IPIR-SI).\n  We first establish a lower bound on the capacity, which is defined as the\nmaximum achievable download rate, of the IPIR-SI problem by presenting a novel\nachievability protocol. Next, we characterize the capacity of IPIR-SI problem\nfor $M = 1$ and $D = 2$. In the process of characterizing the capacity for\narbitrary $M$ and $D$ we present a novel combinatorial conjecture, that may be\nof independent interest.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Jan 2019 18:34:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 2 Feb 2019 00:33:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Heidarzadeh", "Anoosheh", ""], ["Kadhe", "Swanand", ""], ["Rouayheb", "Salim El", ""], ["Sprintson", "Alex", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.07530", "submitter": "Ferdinando Cicalese", "authors": "Ferdinando Cicalese and Luisa Gargano and Ugo Vaccaro", "title": "Minimum--Entropy Couplings and their Applications", "comments": "This paper has been accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on\n  Information Theory. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1701.05243", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.DS math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Given two discrete random variables $X$ and $Y,$ with probability\ndistributions ${\\bf p}=(p_1, \\ldots , p_n)$ and ${\\bf q}=(q_1, \\ldots , q_m)$,\nrespectively, denote by ${\\cal C}({\\bf p}, {\\bf q})$ the set of all couplings\nof ${\\bf p}$ and ${\\bf q}$, that is, the set of all bivariate probability\ndistributions that have ${\\bf p}$ and ${\\bf q}$ as marginals.

Adaptive SCL (ASCL) decoding\ncan greatly enhance the decoding speed, but the decoding latency for each\ncodeword is different so A-SCL is not a good choice for hardware-based\napplications. In this paper, a hardware-friendly two-staged adaptive SCL\n(TA-SCL) decoding algorithm is proposed such that a constant input data rate is\nsupported even if the list size for each codeword is different. A mathematical\nmodel based on Markov chain is derived to explore the bounds of its decoding\nperformance. Simulation results show that the throughput of TA-SCL is tripled\nfor good channel conditions with negligible performance degradation and\nhardware overhead.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Jan 2019 14:46:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-03", "authors_parsed": [["Xia", "ChenYang", ""], ["Fan", "YouZhe", ""], ["Tsui", "Chi-Ying", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.09228", "submitter": "Chunming Tang", "authors": "Chunming Tang, Cunsheng Ding, Maosheng Xiong", "title": "Steiner systems $S(2, 4, \\frac{3^m-1}{2})$ and $2$-designs from ternary\n  linear codes of length $\\frac{3^m-1}{2}$", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.CO math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Coding theory and $t$-designs have close connections and interesting\ninterplay.

By adjusting the\nimportance coefficient, our MIM based framework of data recommendation can then\nbe applied to system with various system requirements and data\ndistributions.Therefore,the obtained results illustrate the physical meaning of\nMIM from the data recommendation perspective and validate the rationality of\nMIM in one aspect.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Jan 2019 09:31:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-27", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Shanyun", ""], ["Dong", "Yunquan", ""], ["Fan", "Pingyi", ""], ["She", "Rui", ""], ["Wan", "Shuo", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.10730", "submitter": "Jean-Guillaume Dumas", "authors": "Jean-Guillaume Dumas (CASYS), Joris Van Der Hoeven (CNRS, LIX),\n  Cl\\'ement Pernet (CASYS), Daniel Roche", "title": "LU factorization with errors *", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SC cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present new algorithms to detect and correct errors in the lower-upper\nfactorization of a matrix, or the triangular linear system solution, over an\narbitrary field.
