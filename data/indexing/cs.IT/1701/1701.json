One of many examples is\nultra-short laser pulse characterization in which the electromagnetic field is\noscillating with ~10^15 Hz and phase information cannot be measured directly\ndue to limitations of the electronic sensors. Phase retrieval is ill-posed in\nmost cases as there are many different signals with the same Fourier transform\nmagnitude. To overcome this fundamental ill-posedness, several measurement\ntechniques are used in practice. One of the most popular methods for complete\ncharacterization of ultra-short laser pulses is the Frequency-Resolved Optical\nGating (FROG). In FROG, the acquired data is the power spectrum of the product\nof the unknown pulse with its delayed replica. Therefore the measured signal is\na quartic function of the unknown pulse. A generalized version of FROG, where\nthe delayed replica is replaced by a second unknown pulse, is called blind\nFROG. In this case, the measured signal is quadratic with respect to both\npulses. In this letter we introduce and formulate FROG-type techniques. We then\nshow that almost all band-limited signals are determined uniquely, up to\ntrivial ambiguities, by blind FROG measurements (and thus also by FROG), if in\naddition we have access to the signals power spectrum.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 Jan 2017 02:47:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 19 Mar 2017 17:35:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 1 Apr 2017 18:48:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-26", "authors_parsed": [["Bendory", "Tamir", ""], ["Sidorenko", "Pavel", ""], ["Eldar", "Yonina C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.02882", "submitter": "Nir Shlezinger", "authors": "Nir Shlezinger, Daniel Zahavi, Yonathan Murin, and Ron Dabora", "title": "The Secrecy Capacity of Gaussian MIMO Channels with Finite Memory - Full\n  Version", "comments": "1 figures.

We propose two forms of attacks, namely: (i)\ndifferent-key attacks, wherein an insider attempts to generate different keys\nat different nodes, especially across nodes that are out of range so that they\nfail to recover group messages despite possessing the group key, and (ii)\nlow-rate key attacks, wherein an insider alters the common source of randomness\nso as to reduce the key-rate.

Recent results have shown that, for the class of\nGaussian HD networks with N relays, there always exists a simple schedule,\ni.e., with at most N +1 active states, that is sufficient for approximate\n(i.e., up to a constant gap) capacity characterization. This paper investigates\nhow to efficiently find such a simple schedule over line networks. Towards this\nend, a polynomial-time algorithm is designed and proved to output a simple\nschedule that achieves the approximate capacity. The key ingredient of the\nalgorithm is to leverage similarities between network states in HD and edge\ncoloring in a graph. It is also shown that the algorithm allows to derive a\nclosed-form expression for the approximate capacity of the Gaussian line\nnetwork that can be evaluated distributively and in linear time.

We extend the above analysis, which\nwas done for a Gaussian point spread function (PSF) to a hard-aperture pupil\nproving the information optimality of image-plane sinc-Bessel modes, and\ngeneralize the result further to an arbitrary PSF. We obtain new\ncounterintuitive insights on energy vs. information content in spatial modes,\nand extend the Fisher Information analysis to exact calculations of minimum\nmean squared error, both for Gaussian and hard aperture pupils.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 Jan 2017 01:08:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-19", "authors_parsed": [["Kerviche", "Ronan", ""], ["Guha", "Saikat", ""], ["Ashok", "Amit", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.04926", "submitter": "Chung Chan", "authors": "Chung Chan, Ali Al-Bashabsheh, Qiaoqiao Zhou", "title": "Agglomerative Info-Clustering", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.LG math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An agglomerative clustering of random variables is proposed, where clusters\nof random variables sharing the maximum amount of multivariate mutual\ninformation are merged successively to form larger clusters.

Their framework\nrequires two oracles, the head- and the tail-approximation projection oracles.\nThe two oracles should return approximate solutions in the model which is\nclosest to the query signal.

In this\npaper, we focus on general heterogeneous distributed computing clusters\nconsisting of a variety of computing machines with different capabilities. We\npropose a coding framework for speeding up distributed computing in\nheterogeneous clusters by trading redundancy for reducing the latency of\ncomputation. In particular, we propose Heterogeneous Coded Matrix\nMultiplication (HCMM) algorithm for performing distributed matrix\nmultiplication over heterogeneous clusters that is provably asymptotically\noptimal for a broad class of processing time distributions. Moreover, we show\nthat HCMM is unboundedly faster than any uncoded scheme. To demonstrate\npracticality of HCMM, we carry out experiments over Amazon EC2 clusters where\nHCMM is found to be up to $61\\%$, $46\\%$ and $36\\%$ respectively faster than\nthree benchmark load allocation schemes - Uniform Uncoded, Load-balanced\nUncoded, and Uniform Coded. Additionally, we provide a generalization to the\nproblem of optimal load allocation in heterogeneous settings, where we take\ninto account the monetary costs associated with the clusters. We argue that\nHCMM is asymptotically optimal for budget-constrained scenarios as well, and we\ndevelop a heuristic algorithm for (HCMM) load allocation for budget-limited\ncomputation tasks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 21 Jan 2017 03:11:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 16 Jun 2017 23:06:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 2 Apr 2018 21:43:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 9 Oct 2018 06:03:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 19 Jun 2019 23:58:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-21", "authors_parsed": [["Reisizadeh", "Amirhossein", ""], ["Prakash", "Saurav", ""], ["Pedarsani", "Ramtin", ""], ["Avestimehr", "Amir Salman", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.05981", "submitter": "Lu Lu", "authors": "Yulin Shao, Soung Chang Liew, Lu Lu", "title": "Asynchronous Physical-layer Network Coding: Symbol Misalignment\n  Estimation and Its Effect on Decoding", "comments": "39 pages, full length version", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In asynchronous physical-layer network coding (APNC) systems, the symbols\nfrom multiple transmitters to a common receiver may be misaligned.

By allowing multiple users to share the\nsame time and frequency, NOMA can scale up the number of served users and\nincrease spectral efficiency compared with existing orthogonal multiple access\n(OMA). Conventional NOMA schemes with successive interference cancellation\n(SIC) do not work well when users with comparable received powers transmit\ntogether. To allow power-balanced NOMA (more exactly, near power-balanced\nNOMA), this paper investigates a new NOMA architecture, named Network-Coded\nMultiple Access (NCMA). A distinguishing feature of NCMA is the joint use of\nphysical-layer network coding (PNC) and multiuser decoding (MUD) to boost NOMA\nthroughputs. We first show that a simple NCMA architecture in which all users\nuse the same modulation, referred to as rate-homogeneous NCMA, can achieve\nsubstantial throughput improvement over SIC-based NOMA under near\npower-balanced scenarios. Then, we put forth a new NCMA architecture, referred\nto as rate-diverse NCMA, in which different users may adopt different\nmodulations commensurate with their relative SNRs. A challenge for rate-diverse\nNCMA is the design of a channel-coded PNC system. This paper is the first\nattempt to design channel-coded rate-diverse PNC. Experimental results on our\nsoftware-defined radio prototype show that the throughput of rate-diverse NCMA\ncan outperform the state-of-the-art rate-homogeneous NCMA by 80%. Overall,\nrate-diverse NCMA is a practical solution for near power-balanced NOMA.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Jan 2017 11:55:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-25", "authors_parsed": [["Pan", "Haoyuan", ""], ["Lu", "Lu", ""], ["Liew", "Soung Chang", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.06852", "submitter": "Huynh Van Luong", "authors": "Huynh Van Luong, Nikos Deligiannis, Jurgen Seiler, Soren Forchhammer,\n  and Andre Kaup", "title": "Incorporating Prior Information in Compressive Online Robust Principal\n  Component Analysis", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.AI math.IT stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider an online version of the robust Principle Component Analysis\n(PCA), which arises naturally in time-varying source separations such as video\nforeground-background separation.

In this work, we introduce a new approach for quantitative\nMRI using MRF, called magnetic resonance Fingerprinting with LOw Rank (FLOR).\n  Methods: We exploit the low rank property of the concatenated temporal\nimaging contrasts, on top of the fact that the MRF signal is sparsely\nrepresented in the generated dictionary domain. We present an iterative scheme\nthat consists of a gradient step followed by a low rank projection using the\nsingular value decomposition.\n  Results: Experimental results consist of retrospective sampling, that allows\ncomparison to a well defined reference, and prospective sampling that shows the\nperformance of FLOR for a real-data sampling scenario.

We show that the\nblock entropy definition of the finite state dimension remains the same if\nnon-aligned blocks are used. Then we provide equivalent definitions in terms of\nautomatic complexity, superadditive bounds for Kolmogorov complexity,\ncalibrated superadditive functions and finite state a priori probability and\nuse them to give simple proofs for known results about finite state dimension,\nand for Agafonov's result saying that normality is preserved by automatic\nselection rules as well as the results of Schnorr and Stimm that relate\nnormality to finite state martingales.\n  Some results of this paper were presented at the Fundamentals in Computing\nTheory conferences in 2017 and 2019. Preliminary version of this paper (that\ndoes not mention the finite state dimension) was published in arxiv in~2017\n(see the previous version of this submission).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 14:39:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 18 Feb 2017 11:48:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 28 Aug 2017 14:26:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 2 Jul 2019 14:54:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 16 Sep 2019 15:00:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Mon, 24 Aug 2020 10:46:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-25", "authors_parsed": [["Kozachinskiy", "Alexander", ""], ["Shen", "Alexander", ""]]}]
