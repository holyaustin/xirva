This analysis\nreveals peaks in information flows during collective U-turns and identifies two\ndifferent flows: an informative flow (positive transfer entropy) based on fish\nthat have already turned about fish that are turning, and a misinformative flow\n(negative transfer entropy) based on fish that have not turned yet about fish\nthat are turning. We also reveal that the information flows are related to\nrelative position and alignment between fish, and identify spatial patterns of\ninformation and misinformation cascades. This study offers several\nmethodological contributions and we expect further application of these\nmethodologies to reveal intricacies of self-organisation in other animal groups\nand active matter in general.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 May 2017 01:03:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-05", "authors_parsed": [["Crosato", "Emanuele", ""], ["Jiang", "Li", ""], ["Lecheval", "Valentin", ""], ["Lizier", "Joseph T.", ""], ["Wang", "X.

It was shown that, over $n$\nindependent channel uses, $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n})$ bits can transmitted reliably\nover a public channel while achieving an arbitrarily low probability of\ndetection (LPD) by other stations. This result is well known as square-root law\nand even to achieve this diminishing rate of covert communication, some form of\nshared secret is needed between the transmitter and the receiver.

We first show that the capacity-achieving input\ndistribution is the zero-mean Gaussian distribution.

We evaluate $\\epsilon$-PD rates in the limiting regimes for the\nnumber of channel uses (asymptotic block length) and the number of antennas\n(massive MIMO). We show that, in the asymptotic block-length regime, while the\nSRL still holds for the MIMO AWGN, the number of bits that can be transmitted\ncovertly scales exponentially with the number of transmitting antennas.\nFurther, we derive the $\\epsilon$-PD capacity \\textit{with no shared secret}.\nFor that scenario, in the massive MIMO limit, higher covert rate up to the non\nLPD constrained capacity still can be achieved, yet, with much slower scaling\ncompared to the scenario with shared secret.

Although separable\ndenoisers are sufficient if the unknown signal has independent and identically\ndistributed entries, in many real-world applications, like image or audio\nsignal reconstruction, the unknown signal contains dependencies between\nentries. In these cases, a coordinate-wise independence structure is not a good\napproximation to the true prior of the unknown signal. In this paper we assume\nthe unknown signal has dependent entries, and using a class of non-separable\nsliding-window denoisers, we prove that a new form of state evolution still\naccurately predicts AMP performance. This is an early step in understanding the\nrole of non-separable denoisers within AMP, and will lead to a characterization\nof more general denoisers in problems including compressive image\nreconstruction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 May 2017 00:01:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 13 Aug 2017 01:56:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-15", "authors_parsed": [["Ma", "Yanting", ""], ["Rush", "Cynthia", ""], ["Baron", "Dror", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.03150", "submitter": "Martianus Frederic Ezerman", "authors": "Zuling Chang, Martianus Frederic Ezerman, Adamas Aqsa Fahreza, San\n  Ling, Janusz Szmidt, and Huaxiong Wang", "title": "Binary de Bruijn Sequences via Zech's Logarithms", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.DM math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The focus of this work is to show how to combine Zech's logarithms and each\nof the cycle joining and cross-join pairing methods to construct binary de\nBruijn sequences of any order.

In contrast to the\navailable analog cancellation architectures, the values for each tap and the\nconfiguration of the multiplexers are jointly designed with the digital\nbeamforming filters according to certain performance objectives. Focusing on a\nnarrowband flat fading channel model as an example, we present a general\noptimization framework for the joint design of analog cancellation and digital\nbeamforming. We also detail a particular optimization objective together with\nits derived solution for the latter architectural components. Representative\ncomputer simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed low\ncomplexity full duplex MIMO system over lately available ones.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 May 2017 10:26:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-16", "authors_parsed": [["Alexandropoulos", "George C.", ""], ["Duarte", "Melissa", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.05168", "submitter": "Qimei Cui", "authors": "Qimei Cui, Yu Gu, Wei Ni, and Renping Liu", "title": "Effective Capacity of Licensed-Assisted Access in Unlicensed Spectrum\n  for 5G: From Theory to Application", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  License-assisted access (LAA) is a promising technology to offload\ndramatically increasing cellular traffic to unlicensed bands.

In order\nto ensure secure communication, the SINR value at each of the secondary nodes\nshould be less than a predefined threshold. Clearly, when more secondary nodes\nare deployed, more primary transmitters will remain silent for a given guard\nzone radius, thus impacting the amount of energy harvested by the secondary\nnetwork.

We\nprovide a summary of this work here along with some of our ongoing research\ndirections such as large-scale array wave-front analysis, optimised power\ncontrol and localisation techniques.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 May 2017 02:40:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Harris", "Paul", ""], ["Hasan", "Wael Boukley", ""], ["Brice", "Henry", ""], ["Chitambira", "Benny", ""], ["Beach", "Mark", ""], ["Mellios", "Evangelos", ""], ["Nix", "Andrew", ""], ["Armour", "Simon", ""], ["Doufexi", "Angela", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.07561", "submitter": "Rakshith Jagannath", "authors": "Rakshith Jagannath", "title": "Detection Estimation and Grid matching of Multiple Targets with Single\n  Snapshot Measurements", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work, we explore the problems of detecting the number of narrow-band,\nfar-field targets and estimating their corresponding directions from single\nsnapshot measurements. The principles of sparse signal recovery (SSR) are used\nfor the single snapshot detection and estimation of multiple targets. In the\nSSR framework, the DoA estimation problem is grid based and can be posed as the\nlasso optimization problem. However, the SSR framework for DoA estimation gives\nrise to the grid mismatch problem, when the unknown targets (sources) are not\nmatched with the estimation grid chosen for the construction of the array\nsteering matrix at the receiver. The block sparse recovery framework is known\nto mitigate the grid mismatch problem by jointly estimating the targets and\ntheir corresponding offsets from the estimation grid using the group lasso\nestimator. The corresponding detection problem reduces to estimating the\noptimal regularization parameter ($\\tau$) of the lasso (in case of perfect\ngrid-matching) or group-lasso estimation problem for achieving the required\nprobability of correct detection ($P_c$). We propose asymptotic and finite\nsample test statistics for detecting the number of sources with the required\n$P_c$ at moderate to high signal to noise ratios. Once the number of sources\nare detected, or equivalently the optimal $\\hat{\\tau}$ is estimated, the\ncorresponding estimation and grid matching of the DoAs can be performed by\nsolving the lasso or group-lasso problem at $\\hat{\\tau}$\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 May 2017 05:32:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Jagannath", "Rakshith", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.07576", "submitter": "Paul Hand", "authors": "Paul Hand, Vladislav Voroninski", "title": "Global Guarantees for Enforcing Deep Generative Priors by Empirical Risk", "comments": "Accepted for presentation at Conference on Learning Theory (COLT)\n  2018", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.LG math.IT math.OC math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We examine the theoretical properties of enforcing priors provided by\ngenerative deep neural networks via empirical risk minimization.

The problem is formulated as a Colonel Blotto game in which the\nattacker seeks to allocate its resources to compromise the CPS, while the\ndefender chooses how to distribute its resources to defend against potential\nattacks. To evaluate the effects of defense and attack, various CPS factors are\nconsidered including human-CPS interactions as well as physical and topological\ncharacteristics of a CPS such as flow and capacity of interconnections and\nminimum path algorithms. Results show that, for the case in which the attacker\nis not aware of the CPS interdependencies, the defender can have a higher\npayoff, compared to the case in which the attacker has complete information.\nThe results also show that, in the case of more symmetric nodes, due to\ninterdependencies, the defender achieves its highest payoff at the equilibrium\ncompared to the case with independent, asymmetric nodes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 May 2017 14:54:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-18", "authors_parsed": [["Ferdowsi", "Aidin", ""], ["Saad", "Walid", ""], ["Maham", "Behrouz", ""], ["Mandayam", "Narayan B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.08339", "submitter": "Carlos Mosquera", "authors": "Carlos Mosquera, Roberto Lopez-Valcarce, Vahid Joroughi", "title": "Distributed Precoding Systems in Multi-Gateway Multibeam Satellites:\n  Regularization and Coarse Beamforming", "comments": "Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper deals with the problem of beamforming design in a multibeam\nsatellite, which is shared by different groups of terminals -clusters-, each\nserved by an Earth station or gateway.

Through this way, the required conditions and iterations can be\ngreatly relaxed and reduced.

In the first method, we utilize circle packing\ntheory to determine the 3-D locations of the UAVs in a way that the total\ncoverage area is maximized. In the second method, we place the UAVs in front of\ntwo building sides and efficiently arrange the UAVs in alternating upsidedown\narrangements. We show that the upside-down arrangements problem can be\ntransformed from 3D to 2D and based on that we present an efficient algorithm\nto solve the problem.

Our system model accounts for channel\nestimation, pilot contamination, arbitrary pathlosses, and multi-group\nmulticasting. We consider six scenarios with different transmission\ntechnologies (unicast and multicast), different pilot assignment strategies\n(dedicated or shared pilot assignments), and different precoding schemes\n(maximum ratio transmission and zero forcing), and derive achievable spectral\nefficiencies for all possible combinations. Then we solve the MMF problem for\neach of these scenarios and for any given pilot length we find the SE\nmaximizing uplink pilot and downlink data transmission policies, all in\nclosed-forms. We use these results to draw a general guideline for massive MIMO\nmulticasting design, where for a given number of base station antennas, number\nof users, and coherence interval length, we determine the multicasting scheme\nthat shall be used.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 May 2017 07:45:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Sadeghi", "Meysam", ""], ["Bj\u00f6rnson", "Emil", ""], ["Larsson", "Erik G.", ""], ["Yuen", "Chau", ""], ["Marzetta", "Thomas L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.11076", "submitter": "Rong Zhang", "authors": "Rong Zhang, Lie-Liang Yang and Lajos Hanzo", "title": "Generalised Precoded Spatial Modulation for Integrated Wireless\n  Information and Power Transfer", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Conventional wireless information transfer by modulating the amplitude, phase\nor frequency leads to an inevitable Rate-Energy (RE) trade-off in the presence\nof simultaneous Wireless Power Transfer (WPT). In echoing Varshney's seminal\nconcept of jointly transmitting both information and energy, we propose the\nso-called Generalised Precoded Spatial Modulation (GPSM) aided Integrated\nWireless Information and Power Transfer (IWIPT) concept employing a power-split\nreceiver. The principle of GPSM is that a particular subset of Receive Antennas\n(RA) is activated and the activation pattern itself conveys useful information.\nHence, the novelty of our GPSM aided IWIPT concept is that RA pattern-based\ninformation transfer is used in addition to the conventional waveform-based\ninformation carried by the classic M-ary modulation. Following the Radio\nFrequency (RF) to Direct Current (DC) power conversion invoked for WPT at the\npower-split receiver, the non-coherent detector simply compares the remaining\nreceived power accumulated by each legitimate RA pattern for the sake of\nidentifying the most likely RA. This operation is then followed by\ndown-conversion and conventional Base Band (BB) M-ary detection. Both our\nanalysis and simulations show that the RA pattern based information transfer\nrepresented in the Spatial Domain (SD) exhibits a beneficial immunity to any\npotential power conversion induced performance degradation and hence improves\nthe overall RE trade-off when additionally the waveform-based information\ntransfer is also taken into account. Moreover, we investigate the impact of\nrealistic imperfect Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT) as well\nas that of the antenna correlations encountered. Finally, the system's\nasymptotic performance is characterised in the context of large-scale Multiple\nInput Multiple Output (MIMO) systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 May 2017 13:27:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Rong", ""], ["Yang", "Lie-Liang", ""], ["Hanzo", "Lajos", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.11095", "submitter": "Stanislav Kruglik", "authors": "Stanislav Kruglik, Marina Dudina, Valeriya Potapova and Alexey Frolov", "title": "On One Generalization of LRC Codes with Availability", "comments": "submitted to ITW 2017. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1702.01314", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We investigate one possible generalization of locally recoverable codes (LRC)\nwith all-symbol locality and availability when recovering sets can intersect in\na small number of coordinates.
