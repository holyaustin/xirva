An (n,k,t)_q\nflash code C is a coding scheme for storing k information bits in n cells in\nsuch a way that any sequence of up to t writes (where a write is a transition 0\n-> 1 or 1 -> 0 in any one of the k bits) can be accommodated without a block\nerasure.

Hence, protection of communication networks is essential\nto increase their reliability, performance, and operations. Much research work\nhas been done to protect against link and node failures, and to provide\nreliable solutions based on pre-defined provision or dynamic restoration of the\ndomain. In this paper we develop network protection strategies against multiple\nlink failures using network coding and joint capacities. In these strategies,\nthe source nodes apply network coding for their transmitted data to provide\nbackup copies for recovery at the receivers' nodes. Such techniques can be\napplied to optical, IP, and mesh networks. The encoding operations of\nprotection codes are defined over finite fields. Furthermore, the normalized\ncapacity of the communication network is given by $(n-t)/n$ in case of $t$ link\nfailures. In addition, a bound on the minimum required field size is derived.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 May 2009 07:44:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Aly", "Salah A.", ""], ["Kamal", "Ahmed E.", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.1883", "submitter": "Paul Cuff", "authors": "Paul Cuff (Stanford University), Han-I Su (Stanford University), Abbas\n  El Gamal (Stanford University)", "title": "Cascade multiterminal source coding", "comments": "ISIT 2009, 5 pages, 1 eps figure, uses IEEEtran.cls", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We investigate distributed source coding of two correlated sources X and Y\nwhere messages are passed to a decoder in a cascade fashion.

The decoder's task is to estimate a function of X and Y. For\nexample, we consider the minimum mean squared-error distortion when encoding\nthe sum of jointly Gaussian random variables under these constraints. We also\ncharacterize the rates needed to reconstruct a function of X and Y losslessly.\n  Our general contribution toward understanding the limits of the cascade\nmultiterminal source coding network is in the form of inner and outer bounds on\nthe achievable rate region for satisfying a distortion constraint for an\narbitrary distortion function d(x,y,z). The inner bound makes use of a balance\nbetween two encoding tactics--relaying the information about X and\nrecompressing the information about X jointly with Y.

Various\napproaches have been proposed in the literature to identify time delays\nintroduced by multipath environments. However, these methods either operate on\nthe analog received signal, or require high sampling rates in order to achieve\nreasonable time resolution. In this paper, our goal is to develop a unified\napproach to time delay estimation from low rate samples of the output of a\nmultipath channel. Our methods result in perfect recovery of the multipath\ndelays from samples of the channel output at the lowest possible rate, even in\nthe presence of overlapping transmitted pulses. This rate depends only on the\nnumber of multipath components and the transmission rate, but not on the\nbandwidth of the probing signal. In addition, our development allows for a\nvariety of different sampling methods. By properly manipulating the low-rate\nsamples, we show that the time delays can be recovered using the well-known\nESPRIT algorithm. Combining results from sampling theory with those obtained in\nthe context of direction of arrival estimation methods, we develop necessary\nand sufficient conditions on the transmitted pulse and the sampling functions\nin order to ensure perfect recovery of the channel parameters at the minimal\npossible rate.

In\nthis paper, we exploit the hidden PR feedback to design new learning and\ntransmission schemes for spectrum sharing based CRs, namely active learning and\nsupervised transmission.

The SSCT has a simple test statistic and does\nnot rely on any deterministic knowledge about primary signals. As figures of\nmerit, the exact false-alarm probability is derived, and the miss-detection\nprobability as well as the average sample number (ASN) are evaluated by using a\nnumerical integration algorithm. Corroborating numerical examples show that, in\ncomparison with fixed-sample size detection schemes such as energy detection,\nthe SSCT delivers considerable reduction on the ASN while maintaining a\ncomparable detection performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 May 2009 15:47:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Xin", "Yan", ""], ["Zhang", "Honghai", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.4700", "submitter": "Zuleita Ka Ming Ho", "authors": "Zuleita Ka Ming Ho, Vincent K.

However,\nconventional cross-layer designs all require channel state information at the\nbase station (CSIT) which is difficult to obtain in practice. In this paper, we\nfocus on cross-layer resource optimization based on ACK/NAK feedback flows in\nOFDM systems without explicit CSIT. While the problem can be modeled as Markov\nDecision Process (MDP), brute force approach by policy iteration or value\niteration cannot lead to any viable solution. Thus, we derive a simple\nclosed-form solution for the MDP cross-layer problem, which is asymptotically\noptimal for sufficiently small target packet error rate (PER). The proposed\nsolution also has low complexity and is suitable for realtime implementation.\nIt is also shown to achieve significant performance gain compared with systems\nthat do not utilize the ACK/NAK feedbacks for cross-layer designs or\ncross-layer systems that utilize very unreliable CSIT for adaptation with\nmismatch in CSIT error statistics. Asymptotic analysis is also provided to\nobtain useful design insights.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 May 2009 16:55:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Ho", "Zuleita Ka Ming", ""], ["Lau", "Vincent K.

The power of nearest interferer is used as a\nmajor performance indicator, instead of a traditionally-used total interference\npower, since at the low outage region, they have the same statistics so that\nthe former is an accurate approximation of the latter. This simplifies the\nproblem significantly and allows one to develop a unified framework for the\noutage probability analysis, including the impacts of complete/partial\ninterference cancelation, of different types of fading and of linear filtering,\neither alone or in combination with each other. When a given number of nearest\ninterferers are completely canceled, the outage probability is shown to scale\ndown exponentially in this number. Three different models of partial\ncancelation are considered and compared via their outage probabilities. The\npartial cancelation level required to eliminate the impact of an interferer is\nquantified. The effect of a broad class of fading processes (including all\npopular fading models) is included in the analysis in a straightforward way,\nwhich can be positive or negative depending on a particular model and\npropagation/system parameters. The positive effect of linear filtering (e.g. by\ndirectional antennas) is quantified via a new statistical selectivity\nparameter. The analysis results in formulation of a tradeoff relationship\nbetween the network density and the outage probability, which is a result of\nthe interplay between random geometry of node locations, the propagation path\nloss and the distortion effects at the victim receiver.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 May 2009 17:40:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Mordachev", "Vladimir", ""], ["Loyka", "Sergey", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.4937", "submitter": "Daniil Ryabko", "authors": "Daniil Ryabko (INRIA Futurs, LIFL, INRIA Lille - Nord Europe)", "title": "A criterion for hypothesis testing for stationary processes", "comments": "part or this report appeared as: Test, vol. 21(2), pp. 317-329, 2012", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST cs.IT math.IT math.PR stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Given a finite-valued sample $X_1,...,X_n$ we wish to test whether it was\ngenerated by a stationary ergodic process belonging to a family $H_0$, or it\nwas generated by a stationary ergodic process outside $H_0$.
