If the problem is\nnon-convex, we show that the capacity can be larger than the formula obtained\nby the naive approach of imposing constraints on the maximization in the\ncapacity formula of the case without the constraints.\n  The extension on the converse proof is simply by adding a term involving the\nLagrange multiplier and the constraints.

Specifically, a limited\nrandomized network coding (L-RNC) scheme - in which intermediate nodes perform\nrandomized encoding based on only a limited number of random coefficients - is\nproposed and its performance bounds are analyzed. Such a L-RNC approach is\napplicable to networks in which nodes have either limited computation/storage\ncapacity or have ambiguity about downstream edge connectivity (e.g., as in ad\nhoc sensor networks). A second tradeoff studied here examines the relationship\nbetween the reliability and the capacity gains of generalized RNC, i.e., how\nthe outage probability of RNC relates to the transmission rate at the source\nnode. This tradeoff reveals that significant reductions in outage probability\nare possible when the source transmits deliberately and only slightly below\nnetwork capacity. This approach provides an effective means to improve the\nfeasibility probability of RNC when the size of the finite field is fixed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Jul 2008 19:03:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 18 Feb 2009 16:27:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Yingda", ""], ["Kishore", "Shalinee", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.1372", "submitter": "Danilo Silva", "authors": "Danilo Silva, Frank R.

The symmetric capacity is the highest\nrate achievable subject to using the input letters of the channel with equal\nprobability. Channel polarization refers to the fact that it is possible to\nsynthesize, out of $N$ independent copies of a given B-DMC $W$, a second set of\n$N$ binary-input channels $\\{W_N^{(i)}:1\\le i\\le N\\}$ such that, as $N$ becomes\nlarge, the fraction of indices $i$ for which $I(W_N^{(i)})$ is near 1\napproaches $I(W)$ and the fraction for which $I(W_N^{(i)})$ is near 0\napproaches $1-I(W)$. The polarized channels $\\{W_N^{(i)}\\}$ are\nwell-conditioned for channel coding: one need only send data at rate 1 through\nthose with capacity near 1 and at rate 0 through the remaining. Codes\nconstructed on the basis of this idea are called polar codes.

A prevalent assumption which often\nguarantees recovery from the given measurements is that $x$ lies in a known\nsubspace.

In this paper we\ndevelop a general framework for robust and efficient recovery of such signals\nfrom a given set of samples.

Compared with previously proposed\nstrategies for CNC, this strategy reduces the channel-coding network-coding\nmismatch. It is not obvious, however, that an efficient decoder for step (i)\nexists. A second contribution of this paper is to provide an explicit\nconstruction of such a decoder based on the use of the Repeat Accumulate (RA)\ncode. Specifically, we redesign the belief propagation algorithm of the RA code\nfor traditional point-to-point channel to suit the need of the PNC\nmultiple-access channel. Simulation results show that our new scheme\noutperforms the previously proposed schemes significantly in terms of BER\nwithout added complexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Jul 2008 02:44:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 18 Jan 2010 07:04:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Shengli", ""], ["Liew", "Soung-Chang", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.4846", "submitter": "Natalia Silberstein", "authors": "Tuvi Etzion and Natalia Silberstein", "title": "Error-Correcting Codes in Projective Spaces via Rank-Metric Codes and\n  Ferrers Diagrams", "comments": "Revised for IEEE Transactions on Information Theory", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Coding in the projective space has received recently a lot of attention due\nto its application in network coding. Reduced row echelon form of the linear\nsubspaces and Ferrers diagram can play a key role for solving coding problems\nin the projective space. In this paper we propose a method to design\nerror-correcting codes in the projective space. We use a multilevel approach to\ndesign our codes. First, we select a constant weight code. Each codeword\ndefines a skeleton of a basis for a subspace in reduced row echelon form. This\nskeleton contains a Ferrers diagram on which we design a rank-metric code. Each\nsuch rank-metric code is lifted to a constant dimension code. The union of\nthese codes is our final constant dimension code. In particular the codes\nconstructed recently by Koetter and Kschischang are a subset of our codes. The\nrank-metric codes used for this construction form a new class of rank-metric\ncodes. We present a decoding algorithm to the constructed codes in the\nprojective space. The efficiency of the decoding depends on the efficiency of\nthe decoding for the constant weight codes and the rank-metric codes. Finally,\nwe use puncturing on our final constant dimension codes to obtain large codes\nin the projective space which are not constant dimension.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Jul 2008 12:18:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 30 Oct 2008 06:45:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 8 Feb 2009 10:16:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 14 Mar 2009 20:04:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Etzion", "Tuvi", ""], ["Silberstein", "Natalia", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.4881", "submitter": "Mabruk Gheryani MG", "authors": "Mabruk Gheryani, Zhiyuan Wu, and Yousef R.

First, we study the\nperformance of the classical loopy max-product belief propagation. We show that\neach fixed point estimate of max-product can be mapped in a natural way to an\nextreme point of the LP polytope associated with the MWIS problem. However,\nthis extreme point may not be the one that maximizes the value of node weights;\nthe particular extreme point at final convergence depends on the initialization\nof max-product. We then show that if max-product is started from the natural\ninitialization of uninformative messages, it always solves the correct LP -- if\nit converges. This result is obtained via a direct analysis of the iterative\nalgorithm, and cannot be obtained by looking only at fixed points.\n  The tightness of the LP relaxation is thus necessary for max-product\noptimality, but it is not sufficient. Motivated by this observation, we show\nthat a simple modification of max-product becomes gradient descent on (a\nconvexified version of) the dual of the LP, and converges to the dual optimum.\nWe also develop a message-passing algorithm that recovers the primal MWIS\nsolution from the output of the descent algorithm. We show that the MWIS\nestimate obtained using these two algorithms in conjunction is correct when the\ngraph is bipartite and the MWIS is unique.\n  Finally, we show that any problem of MAP estimation for probability\ndistributions over finite domains can be reduced to an MWIS problem. We believe\nthis reduction will yield new insights and algorithms for MAP estimation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jul 2008 15:26:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Sanghavi", "Sujay", ""], ["Shah", "Devavrat", ""], ["Willsky", "Alan", ""]]}]
