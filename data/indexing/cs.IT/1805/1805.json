As one of its salient features, the wireless nodes involved in\nphysical-layer GSK generation extract randomness from a subset of their\nwireless channels, referred as the common source of randomness (CSR). Unlike\ntwo-user key generation, in GSK generation, some nodes must act as facilitators\nby broadcasting quantized versions of the linear combinations of the channel\nrealizations, so as to assist all the nodes to observe a CSR. However, we note\nthat broadcasting linear combination of channel realizations incurs non-zero\nleakage of the CSR to an eavesdropper, and moreover, quantizing the linear\ncombination also reduces the overall key-rate. Identifying these issues, we\npropose a practical GSK generation protocol, referred to as Algebraic\nSymmetrically Quantized GSK (A-SQGSK) protocol, in a network of three nodes,\nwherein due to quantization of symbols at the facilitator, the other two nodes\nalso quantize their channel realizations, and use them appropriately over\nalgebraic rings to generate the keys.

The\nfusion center collects the single observation from each of the n sensors to\ndetect a binary parameter. The sensors are clustered into multiple groups, and\ndifferent groups follow different distributions under a given hypothesis. The\nkey challenge for the fusion center is the anonymity of sensors - although it\nknows the exact number of sensors and the distribution of observations in each\ngroup, it does not know which group each sensor belongs to. It is hence natural\nto consider it as a composite hypothesis testing problem. First, we propose an\noptimal test called mixture likelihood ratio test based on the ratio of the\nuniform mixture of all distributions under one hypothesis to that under the\nother. Optimality is shown by first arguing that symmetric tests are optimal,\nwhich do not depend on the order of observations across the sensors, and then\nproving that the mixture likelihood ratio test is optimal among all symmetric\ntests. Second, we focus on the Neyman-Pearson setting and characterize the\nerror exponent of the worst-case type-II error probability as n tends to\ninfinity, assuming the number of sensors in each group is proportional to n.\nFinally, we generalize our result to find the collection of all achievable\ntype-I and type-II error exponents, where the boundary of the region can be\nobtained by solving a convex program.

We show that there exist\nsolutions that decrease the number of hops without affecting the bottleneck SNR\nand provide guidelines on the design of IAB path selection policies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 May 2018 12:12:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 8 Nov 2019 14:58:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-11", "authors_parsed": [["Polese", "Michele", ""], ["Giordani", "Marco", ""], ["Roy", "Arnab", ""], ["Castor", "Douglas", ""], ["Zorzi", "Michele", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.04364", "submitter": "Cheng Zhan", "authors": "Cheng Zhan, Yong Zeng, and Rui Zhang", "title": "Trajectory Design for Distributed Estimation in UAV Enabled Wireless\n  Sensor Network", "comments": "5 pages, 4 figures, submitted for possible journal publication", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT eess.SP math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we study an unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV)-enabled wireless\nsensor network, where a UAV is dispatched to collect the sensed data from\ndistributed sensor nodes (SNs) for estimating an unknown parameter.

Finally, the joint access control and\nbattery prediction problem is investigated, where we propose a two-layer RL\nnetwork to simultaneously deal with maximizing the sum rate and minimizing the\nprediction loss: the first layer is for battery prediction, the second layer\ngenerates the access policy based on the output from the first layer.\nExperiment results show that the three proposed RL algorithms can achieve\nbetter performances compared with existing benchmarks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 May 2018 16:47:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 21 Sep 2018 20:09:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["Chu", "Man", ""], ["Li", "Hang", ""], ["Liao", "Xuewen", ""], ["Cui", "Shuguang", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.06046", "submitter": "Yaoqing Yang", "authors": "Yaoqing Yang, Malhar Chaudhari, Pulkit Grover, Soummya Kar", "title": "Coded Iterative Computing using Substitute Decoding", "comments": "Some parts of this paper will be presented at the 2018 IEEE\n  International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we propose a new coded computing technique called \"substitute\ndecoding\" for general iterative distributed computation tasks.

Detection of cancer\nbiomarkers with conventional blood tests is difficult in the early stages of a\ncancer due to the very low concentration of the biomarkers in the samples\ntaken. However, close to the cancer cells, the concentration of the cancer\nbiomarkers is high. Hence, detection is possible if a sensor with the ability\nto detect these biomarkers is placed in the vicinity of the cancer cells.\nTherefore, in this paper, we study the use of MNSs that are injected at a\nsuitable injection site and can move through the blood vessels of the\ncardiovascular system, which potentially contain cancer cells.

The computation is carried out on a\ndistributed system consisting of a master node and multiple worker nodes. Such\ndistributed systems are significantly slowed down due to the presence of\nslow-running machines (stragglers) as well as various communication\nbottlenecks. We propose \"polynomially coded regression\" (PCR) that\nsubstantially reduces the effect of stragglers and lessens the communication\nburden in such systems. The key idea of PCR is to encode the partial data\nstored at each worker, such that the computations at the workers can be viewed\nas evaluating a polynomial at distinct points. This allows the master to\ncompute the final gradient by interpolating this polynomial. PCR significantly\nreduces the recovery threshold, defined as the number of workers the master has\nto wait for prior to computing the gradient. In particular, PCR requires a\nrecovery threshold that scales inversely proportionally with the amount of\ncomputation/storage available at each worker. In comparison, state-of-the-art\nstraggler-mitigation schemes require a much higher recovery threshold that only\ndecreases linearly in the per worker computation/storage load. We prove that\nPCR's recovery threshold is near minimal and within a factor two of the best\npossible scheme. Our experiments over Amazon EC2 demonstrate that compared with\nstate-of-the-art schemes, PCR improves the run-time by 1.50x ~ 2.36x with\nnaturally occurring stragglers, and by as much as 2.58x ~ 4.29x with artificial\nstragglers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 May 2018 23:59:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Songze", ""], ["Kalan", "Seyed Mohammadreza Mousavi", ""], ["Yu", "Qian", ""], ["Soltanolkotabi", "Mahdi", ""], ["Avestimehr", "A.

This behavior, however, is not tight: we\ngive an example of a rich family of distributions for which local samples\nreveal essentially nothing about the correlations, and where a slightly\nmodified estimator attains a variance of $2^{-\\Omega(k)}$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 May 2018 13:52:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 25 Jun 2018 13:44:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-26", "authors_parsed": [["Hadar", "Uri", ""], ["Shayevitz", "Ofer", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.12542", "submitter": "Pradeep Sarvepalli", "authors": "Vinuta V.
