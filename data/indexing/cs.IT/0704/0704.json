Sensing capacity is defined as the maximum number of signal dimensions\nreliably identified per sensor observation. In this context sparsity of the\nphenomena is a key feature that determines sensing capacity. Precluding the SNR\nof the environment the effect of sparsity on the number of measurements\nrequired for accurate reconstruction of a sparse phenomena has been widely\ndealt with under compressed sensing. Nevertheless the development there was\nmotivated from an algorithmic perspective. In this paper our aim is to derive\nthese bounds in an information theoretic set-up and thus provide algorithm\nindependent conditions for reliable reconstruction of sparse signals. In this\ndirection we first generalize the Fano's inequality and provide lower bounds to\nthe probability of error in reconstruction subject to an arbitrary distortion\ncriteria. Using these lower bounds to the probability of error, we derive upper\nbounds to sensing capacity and show that for fixed SNR regime sensing capacity\ngoes down to zero as sparsity goes down to zero. This means that\ndisproportionately more sensors are required to monitor very sparse events. Our\nnext main contribution is that we show the effect of sensing diversity on\nsensing capacity, an effect that has not been considered before. Sensing\ndiversity is related to the effective \\emph{coverage} of a sensor with respect\nto the field. In this direction we show the following results (a) Sensing\ncapacity goes down as sensing diversity per sensor goes down; (b) Random\nsampling (coverage) of the field by sensors is better than contiguous location\nsampling (coverage).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Apr 2007 19:52:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 14 May 2007 19:08:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 4 Jun 2007 18:21:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Aeron", "Shuchin", ""], ["Zhao", "Manqi", ""], ["Saligrama", "Venkatesh", ""]]}, {"id": "0704.3504", "submitter": "Berry Schoenmakers", "authors": "Berry Schoenmakers, Jilles Tjoelker, Pim Tuyls and Evgeny Verbitskiy", "title": "Smooth R\\'enyi Entropy of Ergodic Quantum Information Sources", "comments": "5 pages, no figures, ISIT 2007", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.IT math.IT", "license": null, "abstract": "  We prove that the average smooth Renyi entropy rate will approach the entropy\nrate of a stationary, ergodic information source, which is equal to the Shannon\nentropy rate for a classical information source and the von Neumann entropy\nrate for a quantum information source.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Apr 2007 09:28:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-13", "authors_parsed": [["Schoenmakers", "Berry", ""], ["Tjoelker", "Jilles", ""], ["Tuyls", "Pim", ""], ["Verbitskiy", "Evgeny", ""]]}, {"id": "0704.3536", "submitter": "Carlos Galindo", "authors": "C.

The approach is applicable to a\nlarge family of multiuser receivers including the matched filter, the\ndecorrelator, the linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) receiver, and the\n(nonlinear) optimal detectors. It exploits the linear relationship that has\nbeen shown to exist between the transmit power and the output\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SIR) in the large-system limit.

In addition,\na unified power control (UPC) algorithm for reaching the Nash equilibrium is\nproposed. The algorithm adjusts the user's transmit powers by iteratively\ncomputing the large-system multiuser efficiency, which is independent of\ninstantaneous spreading sequences. The convergence of the algorithm is proved\nfor the matched filter, the decorrelator, and the MMSE receiver, and is\ndemonstrated by means of simulation for an optimal detector.
