As indicated in the recent article posted\non the US FDA website, the group testing approach for COVID-19 has received a\nlot of interest lately. There are two key elements in a group testing\ntechnique: (i) the pooling matrix that directs samples to be pooled into\ngroups, and (ii) the decoding algorithm that uses the group test results to\nreconstruct the status of each sample. In this paper, we propose a new family\nof pooling matrices from packing the pencil of lines (PPoL) in a finite\nprojective plane. We compare their performance with various pooling matrices\nproposed in the literature, including 2D-pooling, P-BEST, and Tapestry, using\nthe two-stage definite defectives (DD) decoding algorithm. By conducting\nextensive simulations for a range of prevalence rates up to 5%, our numerical\nresults show that there is no pooling matrix with the lowest relative cost in\nthe whole range of the prevalence rates. To optimize the performance, one\nshould choose the right pooling matrix, depending on the prevalence rate. The\nfamily of PPoL matrices can dynamically adjust their column weights according\nto the prevalence rates and could be a better alternative than using a fixed\npooling matrix.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Sep 2020 19:05:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 15 Jun 2021 13:51:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Lin", "Yi-Jheng", ""], ["Yu", "Che-Hao", ""], ["Liu", "Tzu-Hsuan", ""], ["Chang", "Cheng-Shang", ""], ["Chen", "Wen-Tsuen", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.00064", "submitter": "Ayush Jain", "authors": "Ayush Jain, Alon Orlitsky", "title": "Linear-Sample Learning of Low-Rank Distributions", "comments": "Accepted for Neurips 2020", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.IT math.IT math.ST stat.ML stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Many latent-variable applications, including community detection,\ncollaborative filtering, genomic analysis, and NLP, model data as generated by\nlow-rank matrices.

However, 5G and Beyond will depart\nfrom this scheme, with the objective not only to provide services with higher\ndata rates. One of the main goals is to support massive machine-type\ncommunications (mMTC) in the IoT applications. Supporting massive uplink (UP)\ncommunications for devices with sporadic traffic pattern and short-packet size,\nas it is in many mMTC use cases, is a challenging task, particularly when the\ncontrol signaling is not negligible in size compared to the payload. Also,\nchannel estimation is challenging for sporadic and short-packet transmission\ndue to the limited number of employed pilots. In this paper, a new UP multiple\naccess (MA) scheme is proposed for mMTC, which can support a large number of\nuncoordinated IoT devices with short-packet and sporadic traffic. The proposed\nUP MA scheme removes the overheads associated with the device identifier as\nwell as pilots related to channel estimation. An alternative mechanism for\ndevice identification is proposed, where a unique spreading code is dedicated\nto each IoT device. This unique code is simultaneously used for the spreading\npurpose and device identification. Two IoT device identification algorithms\nwhich employ sparse signal reconstruction methods are proposed to determine the\nactive IoT devices prior to data detection. Specifically, the BIC model order\nselection method is employed to develop an IoT device identification algorithm\nfor unknown and time-varying probability of device activity.

Consider a 2D regular grid\nwith source vertex $X$ at layer $0$ and $k+1$ vertices at layer $k\\geq 1$,\nwhich are at distance $k$ from $X$. Every vertex of the 2D regular grid has\noutdegree $2$, the vertices at the boundary have indegree $1$, and all other\nvertices have indegree $2$. At time $0$, $X$ is given a random bit. At time\n$k\\geq 1$, each vertex in layer $k$ receives transmitted bits from its parents\nin layer $k-1$, where the bits pass through binary symmetric channels with\nnoise level $\\delta\\in(0,1/2)$. Then, each vertex combines its received bits\nusing a common Boolean processing function to produce an output bit. The\nobjective is to recover $X$ with probability of error better than $1/2$ from\nall vertices at layer $k$ as $k \\rightarrow \\infty$. Besides their natural\ninterpretation in communication networks, such broadcasting processes can be\nconstrued as 1D probabilistic cellular automata (PCA) with boundary conditions\nthat limit the number of sites at each time $k$ to $k+1$. We conjecture that it\nis impossible to propagate information in a 2D regular grid regardless of the\nnoise level and the choice of processing function. In this paper, we make\nprogress towards establishing this conjecture, and prove using ideas from\npercolation and coding theory that recovery of $X$ is impossible for any\n$\\delta$ provided that all vertices use either AND or XOR processing functions.\nFurthermore, we propose a martingale-based approach that establishes the\nimpossibility of recovering $X$ for any $\\delta$ when all NAND processing\nfunctions are used if certain supermartingales can be rigorously constructed.\nWe also provide numerical evidence for the existence of these supermartingales\nby computing explicit examples for different values of $\\delta$ via linear\nprogramming.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 3 Oct 2020 17:01:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-06", "authors_parsed": [["Makur", "Anuran", ""], ["Mossel", "Elchanan", ""], ["Polyanskiy", "Yury", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.01498", "submitter": "Ningning Han", "authors": "Lin Li, Ningning Han, Qingtang Jiang, Charles K.

To tackle the challenge\nof infinite design variables arising from the continuous-time UAV trajectory\noptimization, a commonly adopted approach is by approximating the UAV\ntrajectory with piecewise-linear path segments in three-dimensional (3D) space.\nHowever, this approach may still incur prohibitive computational complexity in\npractice when the UAV flight period/distance becomes long, as the distance\nbetween consecutive waypoints needs to be kept sufficiently small to retain\nhigh approximation accuracy. To resolve this fundamental issue, we propose in\nthis paper a new and general framework for UAV trajectory and communication\nco-design. First, we propose a flexible path discretization scheme that\noptimizes only a number of selected waypoints (designable waypoints) along the\nUAV path for complexity reduction, while all the designable and non-designable\nwaypoints are used in calculating the approximated communication utility along\nthe UAV trajectory for ensuring high trajectory discretization accuracy. Next,\ngiven any number of designable waypoints, we propose a novel path compression\nscheme where the UAV 3D path is first decomposed into three one-dimensional\n(1D) sub-paths and each sub-path is then approximated by superimposing a number\nof selected basis paths weighted by their corresponding path coefficients, thus\nfurther reducing the path design complexity.

Generalized Lasso (GL) programs are effective\nfor solving GCS problems due to their proven ability to leverage underlying\nsignal structure. Three popular GL programs are equivalent in a sense and\nsometimes used interchangeably. Tuned by a governing parameter, each admit an\noptimal parameter choice. For sparse or low-rank signal structures, this choice\nyields minimax order-optimal error. While GCS is well-studied, existing theory\nfor GL programs typically concerns this optimally tuned setting. However, the\noptimal parameter value for a GL program depends on properties of the data, and\nis typically unknown in practical settings. Performance in empirical problems\nthus hinges on a program's parameter sensitivity: it is desirable that small\nvariation about the optimal parameter choice begets small variation about the\noptimal risk. We examine the risk for these three programs and demonstrate that\ntheir parameter sensitivity can differ for the same data. We prove a\ngauge-constrained GL program admits asymptotic cusp-like behaviour of its risk\nin the limiting low-noise regime. We prove that a residual-constrained Lasso\nprogram has asymptotically suboptimal risk for very sparse vectors. These\nresults contrast observations about an unconstrained Lasso program, which is\nrelatively less sensitive to its parameter choice. We support the asymptotic\ntheory with numerical simulations, demonstrating that parameter sensitivity of\nGL programs is readily observed for even modest dimensional parameters.\nImportantly, these simulations demonstrate regimes in which a GL program\nexhibits sensitivity to its parameter choice, though the other two do not.

In particular, the\ntime-of-arrival (TOA) and angle-of-arrival (AOA) distributions of the\nfirst-arriving multipath component (MPC) are derived. These statistics find\ntheir utility in many applications such as cellular-based localization, channel\nmodeling, and link establishment for mm-wave initial access (IA). Leveraging\ntools from stochastic geometry, a Boolean model is used to statistically\ncharacterize the random locations, orientations, and sizes of reflectors, e.g.,\nbuildings. Assuming non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation is due to first-order\n(i.e., single-bounce) reflections, and that reflectors can either facilitate or\nblock reflections, the distribution of the path length (i.e., absolute time\ndelay) of the first-arriving MPC is derived. This result is then used to obtain\nthe first NLOS bias distribution in the localization literature that is based\non the absolute delay of the first-arriving MPC for outdoor time-of-flight\n(TOF) range measurements. This distribution is shown to match exceptionally\nwell with commonly assumed gamma and exponential NLOS bias models in the\nliterature, which were only attainted previously through heuristic or indirect\nmethods. Continuing under this analytical framework, the AOA distribution of\nthe first-arriving MPC is derived, which gives novel insight into how\nenvironmental obstacles affect the AOA and also represents the first AOA\ndistribution derived under the Boolean Model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Oct 2020 07:49:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-20", "authors_parsed": [["O'Lone", "Christopher E.", ""], ["Dhillon", "Harpreet S.", ""], ["Buehrer", "R.

This strategy and our converse\nresult yield that there is a sharp transition at\n$\\tau=\\max\\limits_{0<\\omega<1}\\frac{\\omega + \\omega^3}{1+4\\omega^3}\\approx\n0.44$ from positive rate to zero rate for two-stage encoding strategies. As\nside results, we derive lower and upper bounds on the size of list-decodable\ncodes for the Z-channel and prove that for a fraction $1/4+\\epsilon$ of\nasymmetric errors, an error-correcting code contains at most\n$O(\\epsilon^{-3/2})$ codewords.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Oct 2020 16:39:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Dec 2020 19:57:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Lebedev", "Alexey", ""], ["Lebedev", "Vladimir", ""], ["Polyanskii", "Nikita", ""]]}]
