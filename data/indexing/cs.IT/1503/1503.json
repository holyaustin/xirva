This paper investigates the partial and exact\nrecovery of communities in the general SBM (in the constant and logarithmic\ndegree regimes), and uses the generality of the results to tackle overlapping\ncommunities.\n  The contributions of the paper are: (i) an explicit characterization of the\nrecovery threshold in the general SBM in terms of a new divergence function\n$D_+$, which generalizes the Hellinger and Chernoff divergences, and which\nprovides an operational meaning to a divergence function analog to the\nKL-divergence in the channel coding theorem, (ii) the development of an\nalgorithm that recovers the communities all the way down to the optimal\nthreshold and runs in quasi-linear time, showing that exact recovery has no\ninformation-theoretic to computational gap for multiple communities, in\ncontrast to the conjectures made for detection with more than 4 communities;\nnote that the algorithm is optimal both in terms of achieving the threshold and\nin having quasi-linear complexity, (iii) the development of an efficient\nalgorithm that detects communities in the constant degree regime with an\nexplicit accuracy bound that can be made arbitrarily close to 1 when a\nprescribed signal-to-noise ratio (defined in term of the spectrum of\n$\\diag(p)Q$) tends to infinity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Mar 2015 16:50:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 4 Apr 2015 16:42:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["Abbe", "Emmanuel", ""], ["Sandon", "Colin", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.00628", "submitter": "David Walnut", "authors": "G\\\"otz E.

Unfortunately,\ntypical positioning techniques based on ranging or on velocity and angular\nmeasurements are inherently limited. To overcome the limitations of specific\npositioning techniques, the fusion of multiple and heterogeneous sensor\ninformation is an appealing strategy. In this paper, we investigate the\nfundamental performance of linear fusion of multiple measurements of the\nposition of mobile nodes, and propose a new distributed recursive position\nestimator. The Cram\\'er-Rao lower bounds for the parametric and a-posteriori\ncases are investigated. The proposed estimator combines information coming from\nranging, speed, and angular measurements, which is jointly fused by a Pareto\noptimization problem where the mean and the variance of the localization error\nare simultaneously minimized. A distinguished feature of the method is that it\nassumes a very simple dynamical model of the mobility and therefore it is\napplicable to a large number of scenarios providing good performance. The main\nchallenge is the characterization of the statistical information needed to\nmodel the Fisher information matrix and the Pareto optimization problem. The\nproposed analysis is validated by Monte Carlo simulations, and the performance\nis compared to several Kalman-based filters, commonly employed for localization\nand sensor fusion. Simulation results show that the proposed estimator\noutperforms the traditional approaches that are based on the extended Kalman\nfilter when no assumption on the model of motion is used. In such a scenario,\nbetter performance is achieved by the proposed method, but at the price of an\nincreased computational complexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Mar 2015 12:12:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["De Angelis", "Alessio", ""], ["Fischione", "Carlo", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.02893", "submitter": "Weiyu Xu", "authors": "Jian-Feng Cai, Xiaobo Qu, Weiyu Xu, Gui-Bo Ye", "title": "Robust recovery of complex exponential signals from random Gaussian\n  projections via low rank Hankel matrix reconstruction", "comments": "17 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT math.NA math.OC stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper explores robust recovery of a superposition of $R$ distinct\ncomplex exponential functions from a few random Gaussian projections.

We then compare the performance\nof GSM in VLC systems with those of other MIMO schemes such as spatial\nmultiplexing (SMP), space shift keying (SSK), generalized space shift keying\n(GSSK), and spatial modulation (SM). Analysis and simulation results show that\nGSM in VLC outperforms the other considered MIMO schemes at moderate to high\nSNRs; for example, for 8 bits per channel use, GSM outperforms SMP and GSSK by\nabout 21 dB, and SM by about 10 dB at $10^{-4}$ BER.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 Mar 2015 12:45:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-12", "authors_parsed": [["Alaka", "S.

Each test takes as input a group of items and produces a binary output\nindicating whether any defective item is present in the group. In a\nnon-adaptive scheme designing a testing scheme is equivalent to the\nconstruction of a disjunct matrix, an $M \\times N$ binary matrix where the\nunion of supports of any $t$ columns does not contain the support of any other\ncolumn. In this paper we consider the scenario where defective items are random\nand follow simple probability distributions. In particular we consider the\ncases where 1) each item can be defective independently with probability\n$\\frac{t}{N}$ and 2) each $t$-set of items can be defective with uniform\nprobability. In both cases our aim is to design a testing matrix that\nsuccessfully identifies the set of defectives with high probability. Both of\nthese models have been studied in the literature before and it is known that\n$O(t\\log N)$ tests are necessary as well as sufficient (via random coding) in\nboth cases. Our main focus is explicit deterministic construction of the test\nmatrices amenable to above scenarios.

We consider both (simultaneous) Nash\nequilibria and (sequential) Stackelberg equilibria. We show that for arbitrary\nscalar sources, in the presence of misalignment, the quantized nature of all\nequilibrium policies holds for Nash equilibria in the sense that all Nash\nequilibria are equivalent to those achieved by quantized encoder policies. On\nthe other hand, all Stackelberg equilibria policies are fully informative.

In the noisy setup, a Gaussian\nsource is to be transmitted over an additive Gaussian channel. The goals of the\nencoder and the decoder are misaligned by a bias term and encoder's cost also\nincludes a penalty term on signal power.

Differences in the channel quality experienced by the\nUEs offer an opportunity to develop D2D-based solutions, where \\textit{(i)} the\nUE with a poor direct link to the eNodeB will forward data to a nearby UE over\na high-quality D2D link; and \\textit{(ii)} the receiving UE then uploads its\nown generated data and the relayed data to the eNodeB over a good uplink\nchannel. A straightforward gain in the data uploading time can be obtained for\nthe first UE. To extend the benefits, also to the relaying UE, enhanced\nD2D-based solutions are proposed that decrease the uploading time of this UE\nbased on the cooperative sharing of the resources allocated by the eNodeB to\nthe cooperating devices. Finally, preliminary results are also presented for a\nmultihop study case, where a chain of devices exploits D2D communications to\nupload data to the eNodeB.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Mar 2015 15:05:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 6 Oct 2015 09:17:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-07", "authors_parsed": [["Orsino", "Antonino", ""], ["Militano", "Leonardo", ""], ["Araniti", "Giuseppe", ""], ["Molinaro", "Antonella", ""], ["Iera", "Antonio", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.09092", "submitter": "Ben Lee Volk", "authors": "Ramprasad Saptharishi, Amir Shpilka, Ben Lee Volk", "title": "Efficiently decoding Reed-Muller codes from random errors", "comments": "18 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Reed-Muller codes encode an $m$-variate polynomial of degree $r$ by\nevaluating it on all points in $\\{0,1\\}^m$.

For random errors one may\nhope for a better result.\n  In this work we give an efficient algorithm (in the block length $n=2^m$) for\ndecoding random errors in Reed-Muller codes far beyond the minimal distance.\nSpecifically, for low rate codes (of degree $r=o(\\sqrt{m})$) we can correct a\nrandom set of $(1/2-o(1))n$ errors with high probability. For high rate codes\n(of degree $m-r$ for $r=o(\\sqrt{m/\\log m})$), we can correct roughly $m^{r/2}$\nerrors.\n  More generally, for any integer $r$, our algorithm can correct any error\npattern in $RM(m,m-(2r+2))$ for which the same erasure pattern can be corrected\nin $RM(m,m-(r+1))$.

For CE\nprecoding in a single-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) channel, a\ndesired constellation is feasible at the receiver if and only if it can be\nscaled to lie in an annulus, whose boundaries are characterized by the\ninstantaneous channel realization. Therefore, if a fixed receiver constellation\nis used for CE precoding in a fading channel, where the annulus is\ntime-varying, there is in general a non-zero probability of encountering a\nchannel that makes CE precoding infeasible, thereby causing a high probability\nof error. To tackle this problem, this paper studies the adaptive receiver\nconstellation design for CE precoding in a single-user MISO flat-fading channel\nwith an arbitrary number of antennas at the transmitter. We first investigate\nthe fixed-rate adaptive receiver constellation design to minimize the symbol\nerror rate (SER). Specifically, an efficient algorithm is proposed to find the\noptimal amplitude-and-phase shift keying (APSK) constellation with two rings\nthat is both feasible and of the maximum minimum Euclidean distance (MED), for\nany given constellation size and instantaneous channel realization. Numerical\nresults show that by using the optimized fixed-rate adaptive receiver\nconstellation, our proposed scheme achieves significantly improved SER\nperformance over CE precoding with a fixed receiver constellation. Furthermore,\nbased on the family of optimal fixed-rate adaptive two-ring APSK constellation\nsets, a variable-rate CE transmission scheme is proposed and numerically\nexamined.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Mar 2015 19:38:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 1 Apr 2015 19:52:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 15 Apr 2015 19:58:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 3 Sep 2015 18:31:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 15 Jul 2016 08:29:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Shuowen", ""], ["Zhang", "Rui", ""], ["Lim", "Teng Joon", ""]]}]
