The state space is common across the\narms, and the arms are independent of each other. The transition probability\nmatrix of one of the arms (the odd arm) is different from the common transition\nprobability matrix of all the other arms. A decision maker, who knows these\ntransition probability matrices, wishes to identify the odd arm as quickly as\npossible, while keeping the probability of decision error small. To do so, the\ndecision maker collects observations from the arms by pulling the arms in a\nsequential manner, one at each discrete time instant. However, the decision\nmaker has a trembling hand, and the arm that is actually pulled at any given\ntime differs, with a small probability, from the one he intended to pull. The\nobservation at any given time is the arm that is actually pulled and its\ncurrent state. The Markov processes of the unobserved arms continue to evolve.\nThis makes the arms restless.\n  For the above setting, we derive the first known asymptotic lower bound on\nthe expected time required to identify the odd arm, where the asymptotics is of\nvanishing error probability. The continued evolution of each arm adds a new\ndimension to the problem, leading to a family of Markov decision problems\n(MDPs) on a countable state space.

Recently, Ye and Abbe [ICML 2018] proposed a\ncoding-theoretic paradigm to characterize a fundamental trade-off between\ncomputation load per worker, communication overhead per worker, and straggler\ntolerance. However, their proposed coding schemes suffer from heavy decoding\ncomplexity and poor numerical stability. In this paper, we develop a\ncommunication-efficient gradient coding framework to overcome these drawbacks.\nOur proposed framework enables using any linear code to design the encoding and\ndecoding functions. When a particular code is used in this framework, its\nblock-length determines the computation load, dimension determines the\ncommunication overhead, and minimum distance determines the straggler\ntolerance. The flexibility of choosing a code allows us to gracefully trade-off\nthe straggler threshold and communication overhead for smaller decoding\ncomplexity and higher numerical stability. Further, we show that using a\nmaximum distance separable (MDS) code generated by a random Gaussian matrix in\nour framework yields a gradient code that is optimal with respect to the\ntrade-off and, in addition, satisfies stronger guarantees on numerical\nstability as compared to the previously proposed schemes.

One problem faced by\nMIM-QBP decoder is that it cannot work well when the fraction of degree-2\nvariable nodes is large. However, sometimes a large fraction of degree-2\nvariable nodes is necessary for a fast encoding structure, as seen in the IEEE\n802.11 standard and the DVB-S2 standard. In contrast, the proposed RCQ decoder\nmay be applied to any off-the-shelf LDPC code, including those with a large\nfraction of degree-2 variable nodes.Our simulations show that a 4-bit Min-Sum\nRCQ decoder delivers frame error rate (FER) performance around 0.1dB of\nfull-precision belief propagation (BP) for the IEEE 802.11 standard LDPC code\nin the low SNR region.The RCQ decoder actually outperforms full-precision BP in\nthe high SNR region because it overcomes elementary trapping sets that create\nan error floor under BP decoding.

A\npopular approach in practice is to factorize the matrix into two compact\nlow-rank factors, and then optimize these factors directly via simple iterative\nmethods such as gradient descent and alternating minimization. Despite\nnonconvexity, recent literatures have shown that these simple heuristics in\nfact achieve linear convergence when initialized properly for a growing number\nof problems of interest.

The\nlimitations of these two approaches are illustrated, and then a recently\nproposed scheme, termed hybrid SIC, which dynamically adapts the SIC decoding\norder is presented and shown to achieve a surprising performance improvement\nthat cannot be realized by the conventional SIC decoding order selection\nschemes individually.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 May 2020 17:27:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-21", "authors_parsed": [["Ding", "Z.", ""], ["Schober", "R.", ""], ["Poor", "H.

We also derive an\nupper bound for the outage probability, from which it is shown that a\nsingle-antenna FAS given any arbitrarily small space can outperform an\nL-antenna maximum ratio combining (MRC) system if N is large enough. Our\nanalysis also reveals the minimum required size of the FAS, and how large N is\nconsidered enough for the FAS to surpass MRC.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 23 May 2020 16:25:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-26", "authors_parsed": [["Wong", "Kai-Kit", ""], ["Shojaeifard", "Arman", ""], ["Tong", "Kin-Fai", ""], ["Zhang", "Yangyang", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.11635", "submitter": "Richard Rohwer", "authors": "Richard Rohwer", "title": "The Optimal 'AND'", "comments": "23 pages, 5 figures, to be submitted (shortened) to NeurIPS20", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST cs.IT cs.LO math.IT stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The joint distribution $P(X,Y)$ cannot be determined from its marginals\n$P(X)$ and $P(Y)$ alone; one also needs one of the conditionals $P(X|Y)$ or\n$P(Y|X)$.

The expectation is\ntaken with respect to Jeffreys' non-informative prior over the possible joint\nprobability values, given the marginals.

One solution is to\noffload the computation intensive tasks to the edge server. However, the\nwireless uploading of the raw data is time consuming and may lead to deadline\nviolation. To reduce the communication cost, lossy data compression can be\nexploited for inference tasks, but may bring more erroneous inference results.\nIn this paper, we propose a dynamic compression ratio selection scheme for edge\ninference system with hard deadlines.

Employing the\npopular oblique extension principle (OEP), from an arbitrary compactly\nsupported $\\dm$-refinable vector function $\\phi$ with multiplicity greater than\none, we prove that we can always derive from $\\phi$ a compactly supported\nmultivariate quasi-tight framelet such that (i) all the framelet generators\nhave the highest possible order of vanishing moments;(ii) its associated fast\nframelet transform is compact with the highest balancing order.For a refinable\nscalar function $\\phi$, the above item (ii) often cannot be achieved\nintrinsically but we show that we can always construct a compactly supported\nOEP-based multivariate quasi-tight framelet derived from $\\phi$ satisfying item\n(i).This paper provides a comprehensive investigation on OEP-based multivariate\nquasi-tight multiframelets and their associated framelet transforms with high\nbalancing orders. This deepens our theoretical understanding of multivariate\nquasi-tight multiframelets and their associated fast multiframelet transforms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 May 2020 00:14:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 29 Oct 2020 02:48:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-30", "authors_parsed": [["Han", "Bin", ""], ["Lu", "Ran", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.12497", "submitter": "O\\u{g}uz Yayla", "authors": "B\\\"u\\c{s}ra \\\"Ozden, O\\u{g}uz Yayla", "title": "Partial direct product difference sets and sequences with ideal\n  autocorrelation", "comments": "11 pages.

Such PAC codes provide\ndramatic improvement in performance as compared to both standard\nsuccessive-cancellation decoding as well as CRC-aided list decoding. Arikan's\nPAC codes are based primarily upon the following ideas: replacing CRC precoding\nwith convolutional precoding (under appropriate rate profiling) and replacing\nlist decoding by sequential decoding. His simulations show that PAC codes,\nresulting from the combination of these ideas, are close to finite-length\nbounds on the performance of any code under ML decoding.\n  One of our main goals in this paper is to answer the following question: is\nsequential decoding essential for the superior performance of PAC codes? We\nshow that similar performance can be achieved using list decoding when the list\nsize $L$ is moderately large (say, $L \\ge 128$). List decoding has distinct\nadvantages over sequential decoding is certain scenarios, such as low-SNR\nregimes or situations where the worst-case complexity/latency is the primary\nconstraint. Another objective is to provide some insights into the remarkable\nperformance of PAC codes. We first observe that both sequential decoding and\nlist decoding of PAC codes closely match ML decoding thereof. We then estimate\nthe number of low weight codewords in PAC codes, using these estimates to\napproximate the union bound on their performance under ML decoding.
