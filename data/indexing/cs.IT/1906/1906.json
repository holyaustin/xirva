Next, using the probability measure Q, we calculate\nthe conditional probability of an event related to any encoded symbol\nconditioned by the observations. Moreover, we transform it into a recursive\nform. In the process of derivation, the metric associated with an encoded\nsequence comes out in a natural way.

In\nthe classical setting, where the number of observations is much larger than the\nnumber of parameters, properties of the maximum likelihood estimator in\nlogistic regression are well understood. Recently, Sur and Candes have studied\nlogistic regression in the high-dimensional regime, where the number of\nobservations and parameters are comparable, and show, among other things, that\nthe maximum likelihood estimator is biased. In the high-dimensional regime the\nunderlying parameter vector is often structured (sparse, block-sparse,\nfinite-alphabet, etc.) and so in this paper we study regularized logistic\nregression (RLR), where a convex regularizer that encourages the desired\nstructure is added to the negative of the log-likelihood function. An advantage\nof RLR is that it allows parameter recovery even for instances where the\n(unconstrained) maximum likelihood estimate does not exist. We provide a\nprecise analysis of the performance of RLR via the solution of a system of six\nnonlinear equations, through which any performance metric of interest (mean,\nmean-squared error, probability of support recovery, etc.) can be explicitly\ncomputed. Our results generalize those of Sur and Candes and we provide a\ndetailed study for the cases of $\\ell_2^2$-RLR and sparse\n($\\ell_1$-regularized) logistic regression.

In the\nconsidered model, each user transmits a superposition of two messages to a base\nstation (BS) with separate transmit power and the BS uses a successive decoding\ntechnique to decode the received messages. To maximize each user's transmission\nrate, the users must adjust their transmit power and the BS must determine the\ndecoding order of the messages transmitted from the users to the BS. This\nproblem is formulated as a sum-rate maximization problem with proportional rate\nconstraints by adjusting the users' transmit power and the BS's decoding order.\nHowever, since the decoding order variable in the optimization problem is\ndiscrete, the original maximization problem with transmit power and decoding\norder variables can be transformed into a problem with only the rate splitting\nvariable. Then, the optimal rate splitting of each user is determined. Given\nthe optimal rate splitting of each user and a decoding order, the optimal\ntransmit power of each user is calculated. Next, the optimal decoding order is\ndetermined by an exhaustive search method. To further reduce the complexity of\nthe optimization algorithm used for sum-rate maximization in RSMA, a user\npairing based algorithm is introduced, which enables two users to use RSMA in\neach pair and also enables the users in different pairs to be allocated with\northogonal frequency. For comparisons, the optimal sum-rate maximizing\nsolutions with proportional rate constraints are obtained in closed form for\nnon-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), frequency division multiple access\n(FDMA), and time division multiple access (TDMA).

Motivated by this, in this paper we study an IRS-enhanced\northogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system under\nfrequency-selective channels and propose a practical transmission protocol with\nchannel estimation. First, to reduce the overhead in channel training and\nestimation and to exploit the channel spatial correlation, we propose a novel\nIRS elements grouping method, where each group consists of a set of adjacent\nIRS elements that share a common reflection coefficient. Based on this grouping\nmethod, we propose a practical transmission protocol where only the combined\nchannel of each group needs to be estimated, thus substantially reducing the\ntraining overhead. Next, with any given grouping and estimated CSI, we\nformulate the problem to maximize the achievable rate by jointly optimizing the\ntransmit power allocation and the IRS passive array reflection coefficients.\nAlthough the formulated problem is non-convex and thus difficult to solve, we\npropose an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution for\nit, by alternately optimizing the power allocation and the passive array\ncoefficients in an iterative manner, along with a customized method for the\ninitialization. Simulation results show that the proposed design significantly\nimproves the OFDM link rate performance as compared to the case without using\nIRS.

While the finite-sample-size measure\nRE is useful to analyze the small sample behavior of detectors, in practice it\nis difficult to compute. In the limit as the signal strength approaches zero at\nan appropriate rate, the RE converges to an asymptotic limit only for very\nlarge sample sizes. This limiting ratio of the number of samples is the ARE,\nwhich lends analytical tractability, but does not provide insights into the\nfinite sample behavior of detectors which is important for practical\napplications. This led researchers to study the convergence of RE to ARE, and\nhas been well-reported for the problem of constant signal detection in\nadditive, independent, and identically distributed noise.

E.g., the\nBitcoin blockchain size has grown over 215GB, in spite of its low throughput.\nThe ledger size for a high throughput blockchain Ripple has already reached\n9TB, and it is growing at an astonishing rate of 12GB per day!\n  In this paper, we propose an architecture based on 'fountain codes', a class\nof erasure codes, that enables any full node to 'encode' validated blocks into\na small number of 'coded blocks', thereby reducing its storage costs by orders\nof magnitude. In particular, our proposed \"Secure Fountain (SeF)\" architecture\ncan achieve a near-optimal trade-off between the storage savings per node and\nthe 'bootstrap cost' in terms of the number of (honest) storage-constrained\nnodes a new node needs to contact to recover the blockchain. A key technical\ninnovation in SeF codes is to make fountain codes secure against adversarial\nnodes that can provide maliciously formed coded blocks. Our idea is to use the\nheader-chain as a 'side-information' to check whether a coded block is\nmaliciously formed while it is getting decoded. Further, the 'rateless\nproperty' of fountain codes helps in achieving high decentralization and\nscalability. Our experiments demonstrate that SeF codes tuned to achieve 1000x\nstorage savings enable full nodes to encode the 191GB Bitcoin blockchain into\n195MB on average. A new node can recover the blockchain from an arbitrary set\nof storage-constrained nodes as long as the set contains ~1100 honest nodes on\naverage. Note that for a 1000x storage savings, the fundamental bound on the\nnumber of honest nodes to contact is 1000: we need about 10% more in practice.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Jun 2019 11:32:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Kadhe", "Swanand", ""], ["Chung", "Jichan", ""], ["Ramchandran", "Kannan", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.12278", "submitter": "Jin Xu", "authors": "Jin Xu and Natarajan Gautam", "title": "Peak Age of Information in Priority Queueing Systems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 67, no. 1, pp.\n  373-390, Jan. 2021", "doi": "10.1109/TIT.2020.3033501", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT math.OC math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a priority queueing system where a single processor serves k\nclasses of packets that are generated randomly following Poisson processes.

For the system with infinite buffer size, we provide closed-form expressions\nof PAoI for both FCFS and LCFS where service time is general and k could be\nlarge. Using those results we investigated the effect of ordering of priorities\nand service disciplines for the various scenarios.
