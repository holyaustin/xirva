OFDM\nsignals exhibit Gaussian characteristics in time domain and fourth order\ncumulants of Gaussian distributed signals vanish in contrary to the cumulants\nof other signals. Thus fourth order cumulants can be utilized for OFDM signal\nidentification. In this paper, first, formulations of the estimates of the\nfourth order cumulants for OFDM signals are provided. Then it is shown these\nestimates are affected significantly from the wireless channel impairments,\nfrequency offset, phase offset and sampling mismatch. To overcome these\nproblems, a general chi-square constant false alarm rate Gaussianity test which\nemploys estimates of cumulants and their covariances is adapted to the specific\ncase of wireless OFDM signals. Estimation of the covariance matrix of the\nfourth order cumulants are greatly simplified peculiar to the OFDM signals. A\nmeasurement setup is developed to analyze the performance of the identification\nmethod and for comparison purposes. A parametric measurement analysis is\nprovided depending on modulation order, signal to noise ratio, number of\nsymbols, and degree of freedom of the underlying test.

In this paper, we develop\nlow-complexity thread scheduling policies for several important classes of data\ndownloading time distributions, and prove that these policies are either\ndelay-optimal or within a constant gap from the optimum delay performance.\nThese theoretical results hold for an arbitrary arrival process of read\nrequests that may contain finite or infinite read requests, and for\nheterogeneous MDS storage codes that can support diverse storage redundancy and\nreliability requirements for different data files. Our numerical results show\nthat the delay performance of the proposed policies is significantly better\nthan that of First-Come- First-Served (FCFS) policies considered in prior work.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Jan 2015 21:57:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 10 Jan 2015 19:39:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 24 Jan 2015 10:02:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Sun", "Yin", ""], ["Zheng", "Zizhan", ""], ["Koksal", "C.

Second, it gives rise to the issue on how to balance spectral\nefficiency for information transmission and energy efficiency for power\ntransfer in order to obtain an optimal tradeoff. Third, there exists a security\nissue for information transmission in order to improve power transfer\nefficiency. In this context, multi-antenna techniques, e.g., energy\nbeamforming, are introduced to solve these problems by exploiting spatial\ndegree of freedom. This article provides a tutorial on various aspects of\nmulti-antenna based WIPT techniques, with a focus on tackling the challenges by\nparameter optimization and protocol design.

The deafness problem, that is, a misalignment\nbetween transmitter and receiver beams, demands a time consuming beam-searching\noperation, which leads to an alignment-throughput tradeoff. Moreover, the\nexisting mmW standards schedule a single link in each time slot and hence do\nnot fully exploit the potential of mmW communications, where directional\ncommunications allow multiple concurrent transmissions.

This characterization yields a\ngeometric interpretation of the minimal Chernoff information subject to a\nconstraint on the total variation distance. This paper also derives an\nexponential upper bound on the performance of binary linear block codes (or\ncode ensembles) under maximum-likelihood decoding. Its derivation relies on the\nGallager bounding technique, and it reproduces the Shulman-Feder bound as a\nspecial case. The bound is expressed in terms of the Renyi divergence from the\nnormalized distance spectrum of the code (or the average distance spectrum of\nthe ensemble) to the binomially distributed distance spectrum of the\ncapacity-achieving ensemble of random block codes. This exponential bound\nprovides a quantitative measure of the degradation in performance of binary\nlinear block codes (or code ensembles) as a function of the deviation of their\ndistance spectra from the binomial distribution. An efficient use of this bound\nis considered.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Jan 2015 10:03:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 18 Feb 2015 07:22:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 4 Mar 2015 00:15:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 26 Oct 2015 13:52:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-27", "authors_parsed": [["Sason", "Igal", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.03643", "submitter": "Hui Zhang", "authors": "Hui Zhang", "title": "On robust width property for Lasso and Dantzig selector", "comments": "8 pages; A mistake has been corrected", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recently, Cahill and Mixon completely characterized the sensing operators in\nmany compressed sensing instances with a robust width property.

Although the methodology applies to general scenarios, the\npresent work focuses on a situation with an asymmetric observation structure\nthat only involves two agents.

In both cases, the second agent has access to some strictly\ncausal observations of the first agent's actions, which enables the two agents\nto coordinate. These scenarios are applied to the problem of distributed power\ncontrol; the key idea is that a transmitter may embed information about the\nwireless channel state into its transmit power levels so that an observation of\nthese levels, e.g. the signal-to-interference plus noise ratio, allows the\nother transmitter to coordinate its power levels. The main contributions of\nthis paper are twofold.

The last decade has\nwitnessed a surge of algorithms and theoretical results addressing this\nquestion.

(ii) If we employ iterative\nmethods that aim to converge to a local minima of LPLS, then under good\ninitialization these algorithms converge to a solution that is closer to $x_o$\nthan $\\hat{x}(\\gamma,1)$.

In\nparticular, this agrees with Nair and Wang's result, which states that the idea\nof indirect decoding - introduced to improve the K\\\"orner and Marton inner\nbound - does not provide a better region for this scenario. Further, some\nsecrecy constraints are introduced by letting the private messages to be\nconfidential ones. Two different secrecy criteria are considered: joint secrecy\nand individual secrecy. For both criteria, a general achievable rate region is\nprovided. Moreover, the joint and individual secrecy capacity regions are\nestablished, if the two legitimate receivers are more capable than the\neavesdropper. The established capacity regions indicate that the individual\nsecrecy criterion can provide a larger capacity region as compared to the joint\none, because each cognizant message can be used as a secret key for the other\nindividual message. Further, the joint secrecy capacity is established for a\nmore general class of more capable channels, where only one of the two\nlegitimate receivers is more capable than the eavesdropper. This was done by\nshowing that principle of indirect decoding introduced by Nair and El Gamal is\noptimal for this class of channels.

Additionally we create a\nbit-list of 256 positions(one for every possible ASCII-character), in which we\nwill store, if a specific (ASCII-)character is compressible(1) or not(0). Using\nthis list, we can now say, if a character is compressible (store [the\ncharacter]+[it's run]) or if it is not compressible (store [the character] only\nand the next character is NOT a run, but the following character instead).\nUsing this list, we can also successfully decode the data(if the character is\ncompressible, the next character is a run, if not compressible, the next\ncharacter is a normal character).

The analysis sheds\nlight on the impact of different compression strategies, namely the\nconventional compression log-likelihood ratios and the direct digitization of\nbaseband signals, on the throughput. Then, coding strategies based on layered\nmodulation and optimized coding blocklength are investigated, highlighting the\nbenefits of HARQ buffer-aware transmission schemes. The optimization of\nbaseband compression for multiple-antenna links is also studied, demonstrating\nthe optimality of a transform coding approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 25 Jan 2015 14:43:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 24 Mar 2015 15:52:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 30 Mar 2015 20:13:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Lee", "Wonju", ""], ["Simeone", "Osvaldo", ""], ["Kang", "Joonhyuk", ""], ["Rangan", "Sundeep", ""], ["Popovski", "Petar", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.06194", "submitter": "Ilan Shomorony", "authors": "Ilan Shomorony, Thomas Courtade, and David Tse", "title": "Do Read Errors Matter for Genome Assembly?", "comments": "Submitted to ISIT 2015", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT q-bio.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  While most current high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies generate short\nreads with low error rates, emerging sequencing technologies generate long\nreads with high error rates.

For\nthe Gaussian model, in addition to the strong and weak eavesdropper cases, the\ncapacity region is characterized for the low and high SNR regimes when the\neavesdropper's channel is stronger than one receiver but weaker than the other.\nRemarkably, positive secure transmission rates are always guaranteed under the\nindividual secrecy constraint, unlike the case of the joint secrecy constraint\n(i.e., the information leakage from both messages to the eavesdropper is made\nvanishing). Thus, this notion of secrecy serves as an appropriate candidate for\ntrading off secrecy level and transmission rate; making secrecy more affordable\nbut still acceptable to the end user.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Jan 2015 19:11:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 25 Feb 2015 17:01:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Yanling", ""], ["Koyluoglu", "O.

The transmit\nbeamforming vectors and receive power splitting (PS) ratios are jointly\ndesigned in order to minimize the total transmission power subject to both\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and EH constraints. Most joint\nbeamforming and power splitting (JBPS) designs assume that perfect channel\nstate information (CSI) is available; however CSI errors are inevitable in\npractice. To overcome this limitation, we study the robust JBPS design problem\nassuming a norm-bounded error (NBE) model for the CSI. Three different solution\napproaches are proposed for the robust JBPS problem, each one leading to a\ndifferent computational algorithm. Firstly, an efficient semidefinite\nrelaxation (SDR)-based approach is presented to solve the highly non-convex\nJBPS problem, where the latter can be formulated as a semidefinite programming\n(SDP) problem. A rank-one recovery method is provided to recover a robust\nfeasible solution to the original problem. Secondly, based on second order cone\nprogramming (SOCP) relaxation, we propose a low complexity approach with the\naid of a closed-form robust solution recovery method. Thirdly, a new iterative\nmethod is also provided which can achieve near-optimal performance when the\nSDR-based algorithm results in a higher-rank solution. We prove that this\niterative algorithm monotonically converges to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)\nsolution of the robust JBPS problem.
