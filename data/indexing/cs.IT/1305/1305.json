This problem, known as physical-layer multicasting, has drawn\nmuch interest. Presently, a popularized approach is transmit beamforming, in\nwhich the beamforming optimization is handled by a rank-one approximation\nmethod called semidefinite relaxation (SDR). SDR-based beamforming has been\nshown to be promising for a small or moderate number of users. This paper\ndescribes two new transceiver strategies for physical-layer multicasting. The\nfirst strategy, called stochastic beamforming (SBF), randomizes the beamformer\nin a per-symbol time-varying manner, so that the rank-one approximation in SDR\ncan be bypassed. We propose several efficiently realizable SBF schemes, and\nprove that their multicast achievable rate gaps with respect to the MISO\nmulticast capacity must be no worse than 0.8314 bits/s/Hz, irrespective of any\nother factors such as the number of users. The use of channel coding and the\nassumption of sufficiently long code lengths play a crucial role in achieving\nthe above result. The second strategy combines transmit beamforming and the\nAlamouti space-time code. The result is a rank-two generalization of SDR-based\nbeamforming. We show by analysis that this SDR-based beamformed Alamouti scheme\nhas a better worst-case effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scaling, and\nhence a better multicast rate scaling, than SDR-based beamforming. We further\nthe work by combining SBF and the beamformed Alamouti scheme, wherein an\nimproved constant rate gap of 0.39 bits/s/Hz is proven. Simulation results show\nthat under a channel-coded, many-user setting, the proposed multicast\ntransceiver schemes yield significant SNR gains over SDR-based beamforming at\nthe same bit error rate level.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 May 2013 15:37:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 16 Jul 2013 09:54:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Xiaoxiao", ""], ["Ma", "Wing-Kin", ""], ["So", "Anthony Man-Cho", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.2169", "submitter": "Gregory Ely", "authors": "Gregory Ely, Shuchin Aeron", "title": "Robust Hydraulic Fracture Monitoring (HFM) of Multiple Time Overlapping\n  Events Using a Generalized Discrete Radon Transform", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/IGARSS.2012.6351517", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.geo-ph cs.IT math.IT stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work we propose a novel algorithm for multiple-event localization for\nHydraulic Fracture Monitoring (HFM) through the exploitation of the sparsity of\nthe observed seismic signal when represented in a basis consisting of space\ntime propagators.

We show that\nNMSE is maximized as $\\sigma\\rightarrow 0$ and we find the \\emph{exact} worst\ncase NMSE, which has a simple geometric interpretation: the\nmean-squared-distance of a standard normal vector to the $\\lambda$-scaled\nsubdifferential $\\lambda\\partial f(x_0)$. When $\\lambda$ is optimally tuned to\nminimize the worst-case NMSE, our results can be related to the constrained\ndenoising problem $\\min_{f(x)\\leq f(x_0)}\\{\\|y-x\\|_2\\}$. The paper also\nconnects these results to the generalized LASSO problem, in which, one solves\n$\\min_{f(x)\\leq f(x_0)}\\{\\|y-Ax\\|_2\\}$ to estimate $x_0$ from noisy linear\nobservations $y=Ax_0+z$. We show that certain properties of the LASSO problem\nare closely related to the denoising problem. In particular, we characterize\nthe normalized LASSO cost and show that it exhibits a \"phase transition\" as a\nfunction of number of observations. Our results are significant in two ways.\nFirst, we find a simple formula for the performance of a general convex\nestimator. Secondly, we establish a connection between the denoising and linear\ninverse problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 May 2013 09:21:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 15 May 2013 19:33:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 12 Nov 2013 12:23:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 13 Nov 2013 03:41:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 14 Nov 2013 14:30:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Oymak", "Samet", ""], ["Hassibi", "Babak", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.2789", "submitter": "Volker Pohl", "authors": "Volker Pohl, Fanny Yang, Holger Boche", "title": "Phaseless Signal Recovery in Infinite Dimensional Spaces using\n  Structured Modulations", "comments": "Preprint accepted for publication in the Journal of Fourier Analysis\n  and Applications", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper considers the recovery of continuous signals in infinite\ndimensional spaces from the magnitude of their frequency samples.

Starting from the known local functional dependencies\ninduced by the communications network, we introduce the notion of irreducible\nsets, which characterize implied functional dependencies. We provide recursions\nfor computation of all maximal irreducible sets. These sets act as\ninformation-theoretic bottlenecks, and provide an easily computable outer\nbound. We extend the notion of irreducible sets (and resulting outer bound) for\nnetworks with independent sources. We compare our bounds with existing bounds\nin the literature. We find that our new bounds are the best among the known\ngraph theoretic bounds for networks with correlated sources and for networks\nwith independent sources.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 16 May 2013 08:22:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 10 Feb 2016 12:09:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-13", "authors_parsed": [["Thakor", "Satyajit", ""], ["Grant", "Alex", ""], ["Chan", "Terence", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.3733", "submitter": "Jad Hachem", "authors": "Jad Hachem, I-Hsiang Wang, Christina Fragouli, Suhas Diggavi", "title": "Coding with Encoding Uncertainty", "comments": "12 pages; a shorter version of this work will appear in the\n  proceedings of ISIT 2013", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the channel coding problem when errors and uncertainty occur in the\nencoding process.

The\nsecond issue is how D2D users should choose between communicating directly or\nvia the base station, a choice that depends on distance between the potential\nD2D transmitter and receiver. We propose a tractable hybrid network model where\nthe positions of mobiles are modeled by random spatial Poisson point process,\nwith which we present a general analytical approach that allows a unified\nperformance evaluation for these questions. Then, we derive analytical rate\nexpressions and apply them to optimize the two D2D spectrum sharing scenarios\nunder a weighted proportional fair utility function. We find that as the\nproportion of potential D2D mobiles increases, the optimal spectrum partition\nin the overlay is almost invariant (when D2D mode selection threshold is large)\nwhile the optimal spectrum access factor in the underlay decreases. Further,\nfrom a coverage perspective, we reveal a tradeoff between the spectrum access\nfactor and the D2D mode selection threshold in the underlay: as more D2D links\nare allowed (due to a more relaxed mode selection threshold), the network\nshould actually make less spectrum available to them to limit their\ninterference.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 18 May 2013 02:59:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 22 Jun 2013 17:34:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 26 Nov 2013 15:02:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 6 Mar 2014 22:59:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 23 Sep 2014 21:25:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Lin", "Xingqin", ""], ["Andrews", "Jeffrey G.", ""], ["Ghosh", "Amitava", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.4240", "submitter": "Cui Hongyu", "authors": "Hongyu Cui, Rongqing Zhang, Lingyang Song, and Bingli Jiao", "title": "Relay Selection for Bidirectional AF Relay Network with Outdated CSI", "comments": "accepted by IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Most previous researches on bidirectional relay selection (RS) typically\nassume perfect channel state information (CSI).

The relationship between Pareto-optimal boundary points\nof the capacity region and the generalized Nash equilibria (GNEs) are derived\nfor the several special cases and in all these cases it is shown that all the\nGNEs are Pareto-optimal, demonstrating that there is no loss in efficiency when\nplayers adopt strategic behavior in these scenarios. Several key equivalence\nrelations are derived and used to demonstrate a game-theoretic duality between\nthe Gaussian MAC and the Gaussian BC. This duality allows a parametrized\ncomputation of the equilibria of the BC in terms of the equilibria of the MAC\nand paves the way to translate several MAC results to the dual BC scenario.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 May 2013 03:43:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-22", "authors_parsed": [["Yerramalli", "Srinivas", ""], ["Jain", "Rahul", ""], ["Mitra", "Urbashi", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.4746", "submitter": "Remi Chou", "authors": "Remi A.

This work aims at an in-depth\nexamination of the relation between algebraic coding and network topologies.

In order to scale informed transmitter\nschemes to emerging massive MIMO systems with a large number of transmit\nantennas at the base station, one common approach is to employ time division\nduplexing (TDD) and to exploit the implicit feedback obtained from channel\nreciprocity.

Its original\nformulation, due to Clausius, states that \"Heat can never pass from a colder to\na warmer body without some other change, connected therewith, occurring at the\nsame time\". The second law applies to systems composed of many particles\ninteracting; however, we are seeing that one can make sense of thermodynamics\nin the regime where we only have a small number of particles interacting with a\nheat bath. Is there a second law of thermodynamics in this regime? Here, we\nfind that for processes which are cyclic or very close to cyclic, the second\nlaw for microscopic systems takes on a very different form than it does at the\nmacroscopic scale, imposing not just one constraint on what state\ntransformations are possible, but an entire family of constraints. In\nparticular, we find a family of free energies which generalise the traditional\none, and show that they can never increase. We further find that there are\nthree regimes which determine which family of second laws govern state\ntransitions, depending on how cyclic the process is. In one regime one can\ncause an apparent violation of the usual second law, through a process of\nembezzling work from a large system which remains arbitrarily close to its\noriginal state. These second laws are not only relevant for small systems, but\nalso apply to individual macroscopic systems interacting via long-range\ninteractions, which only satisfy the ordinary second law on average. By making\nprecise the definition of thermal operations, the laws of thermodynamics take\non a simple form with the first law defining the class of thermal operations,\nthe zeroeth law emerging as a unique condition ensuring the theory is\nnontrivial, and the remaining laws being a monotonicity property of our\ngeneralised free energies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 May 2013 22:08:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 4 Sep 2013 08:20:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 3 Dec 2013 15:29:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 25 Sep 2014 05:08:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["Brandao", "Fernando G.

CS exploits the signal's sparsity or compressibility in a\nparticular domain and integrates data compression and acquisition, thus\nallowing exact reconstruction through relatively few non-adaptive linear\nmeasurements. While conventional CS theory relies on data representation in the\nform of vectors, many data types in various applications such as color imaging,\nvideo sequences, and multi-sensor networks, are intrinsically represented by\nhigher-order tensors. Application of CS to higher-order data representation is\ntypically performed by conversion of the data to very long vectors that must be\nmeasured using very large sampling matrices, thus imposing a huge computational\nand memory burden. In this paper, we propose Generalized Tensor Compressive\nSensing (GTCS)--a unified framework for compressive sensing of higher-order\ntensors which preserves the intrinsic structure of tensor data with reduced\ncomputational complexity at reconstruction. GTCS offers an efficient means for\nrepresentation of multidimensional data by providing simultaneous acquisition\nand compression from all tensor modes. In addition, we propound two\nreconstruction procedures, a serial method (GTCS-S) and a parallelizable method\n(GTCS-P). We then compare the performance of the proposed method with Kronecker\ncompressive sensing (KCS) and multi way compressive sensing (MWCS). We\ndemonstrate experimentally that GTCS outperforms KCS and MWCS in terms of both\nreconstruction accuracy (within a range of compression ratios) and processing\nspeed. The major disadvantage of our methods (and of MWCS as well), is that the\ncompression ratios may be worse than that offered by KCS.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 May 2013 16:01:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 Oct 2013 17:42:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 12 Apr 2014 20:58:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 3 Sep 2014 15:29:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Friedland", "Shmuel", ""], ["Li", "Qun", ""], ["Schonfeld", "Dan", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.5884", "submitter": "An Liu Dr", "authors": "An Liu and Vincent K.

We first focus on the regime of a fixed number of\nantennas and large number of users, and show that opportunistic beamforming\nwith user selection yields significant gain, and thus, channel correlation may\nyield a capacity improvement over the uncorrelated \"isotropic\" channel result\nof Sharif and Hassibi. We prove that in the presence of different correlations\namong groups, a block diagonalization approach for the design of\npre-beamformers achieves the optimal sum-rate scaling. Next, we consider the\nregime of large number of antennas and users, where user selection does not\nprovide significant gain. Here, we propose a simplified user grouping algorithm\nto cluster users into groups when the number of antennas becomes very large, in\na realistic setting where users are randomly distributed and have different\nangles of arrival and angular spreads depending on the propagation environment.\nOur subsequent analysis leads to a probabilistic scheduling algorithm, where\nusers within each group are preselected at random based on probabilities\nderived from the large system analysis, depending on the fairness criterion.\nThis is advantageous since only the selected users are required to feedback\ntheir channel state information (CSIT).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 May 2013 20:52:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Adhikary", "Ansuman", ""], ["Caire", "Giuseppe", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.7294", "submitter": "Chunming Tang", "authors": "Chunming Tang, Yanfeng Qi, Maozhi Xu", "title": "A Note on Cyclic Codes from APN Functions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Cyclic codes, as linear block error-correcting codes in coding theory, play a\nvital role and have wide applications.

The acclaimed SINR\nmaximization (max-SINR) algorithm does not achieve fairness between user's\nstreams, i.e., sub-stream fairness is not achieved. To this end, we propose a\ndistributed power control algorithm to render sub-stream fairness in the\nsystem. Sub-stream fairness is a less restrictive design metric than stream\nfairness (i.e., fairness between all streams) thus sum-rate degradation is\nmilder. Algorithmic parameters can significantly differentiate the results of\nnumerical algorithms. A complete picture for comparison of algorithms can only\nbe depicted by varying these parameters. For example, a predetermined iteration\nnumber or a negligible increment in the sum-rate can be the stopping criteria\nof an algorithm. While the distributed interference alignment (DIA) can\nreasonably achieve sub-stream fairness for the later, the imbalance between\nsub-streams increases as the preset iteration number decreases. Thus comparison\nof max-SINR and DIA with a low preset iteration number can only depict a part\nof the picture. We analyze such important parameters and their effects on SINR\nand rate metrics to exhibit numerical correctness in executing the benchmarks.\nFinally, we propose group filtering schemes that jointly design the streams of\na user in contrast to max-SINR scheme that designs each stream of a user\nseparately.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 May 2013 08:45:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 16 Jun 2013 13:34:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Yetis", "Cenk M.", ""], ["Zeng", "Yong", ""], ["Anand", "Kushal", ""], ["Guan", "Yong Liang", ""], ["Gunawan", "Erry", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.7393", "submitter": "Anwarul Azim", "authors": "Anwarul Azim", "title": "Performance of Single User vs. Multiuser Modulation in Wireless\n  Multicarrier (MC) Communications", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  The main objective of this paper is to compare block transmission system\nperformance analytically for Code Divisional Multiple Access (CDMA) modulations\nin Generalized Multicarrier environment against linear modulation techniques\nfor both single user and multiuser.
