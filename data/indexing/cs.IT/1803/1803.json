In dense machine-to-machine networks, MTDs are typically\nlocated within close proximity and will gather correlated data, and, thus,\nclustering MTDs based on data correlation will lead to a decrease in the number\nof redundant bits transmitted to the base station. To analyze this clustering\nproblem, a novel utility function that captures the average MTD transmission\npower per cluster is derived, as a function of the MTD location, cluster size,\nand inter-cluster interference. Then, the clustering problem is formulated as\nan evolutionary game, which models the interactions among the massive number of\nMTDs, in order to decrease MTD transmission power. To solve this game, a\ndistributed algorithm is proposed to allow the infinite number of MTDs to\nautonomously form clusters.

This paper focuses on a\nvariant of coded caching successively proposed for the so-called combination\nnetwork, where the multicast message is further encoded by a Maximum Distance\nSeparable (MDS) code and the MDS-coded blocks are simultaneously transmitted\nfrom different Edge Nodes (ENs) (e.g., base stations or access points).

Hence, in order to provide DL channel state\ninformation to the Base Station (BS), closed-loop DL channel probing and\nChannel State Information (CSI) feedback is needed. In massive MIMO this incurs\ntypically a large training overhead. For example, in a typical configuration\nwith M = 200 BS antennas and fading coherence block of T = 200 symbols, the\nresulting rate penalty factor due to the DL training overhead, given by max{0,\n1 - M/T}, is close to 0. To reduce this overhead, we build upon the well-known\nfact that the Angular Scattering Function (ASF) of the user channels is\ninvariant over frequency intervals whose size is small with respect to the\ncarrier frequency (as in current FDD cellular standards). This allows to\nestimate the users' DL channel covariance matrix from UL pilots without\nadditional overhead.

We\nstudy both the conventional MCC where tasks are offloaded to the cloud through\na wireless access point, and MCC with a computing access point (CAP), where the\nCAP serves both as the network access gateway and a computation service\nprovider to the mobile users. We aim to jointly optimize the offloading\ndecisions of all users as well as the allocation of computation and\ncommunication resources, to minimize the overall cost of energy, computation,\nand delay for all users. The optimization problem is formulated as a non-convex\nquadratically constrained quadratic program, which is NP-hard in general. For\nthe case without a CAP, an efficient approximate solution named MUMTO is\nproposed by using separable semidefinite relaxation (SDR), followed by recovery\nof the binary offloading decision and optimal allocation of the communication\nresource. To solve the more complicated problem with a CAP, we further propose\nan efficient three-step algorithm named MUMTO-C comprising of generalized MUMTO\nSDR with CAP, alternating optimization, and sequential tuning, which always\ncomputes a locally optimal solution. For performance benchmarking, we further\npresent numerical lower bounds of the minimum system cost with and without the\nCAP. By comparison with this lower bound, our simulation results show that the\nproposed solutions for both scenarios give nearly optimal performance under\nvarious parameter settings, and the resultant efficient utilization of a CAP\ncan bring substantial cost benefit.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 17 Mar 2018 21:54:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 8 Aug 2018 14:35:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-20", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Meng-Hsi", ""], ["Liang", "Ben", ""], ["Dong", "Min", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.06602", "submitter": "Weijun Fang", "authors": "Weijun Fang and Fang-Wei Fu", "title": "Two new classes of quantum MDS codes", "comments": "14 pages.

Historically, time, frequency and\nmore recently, spatial dimensions have been used to improve capacity and\nrobustness. Paradoxically, radiocommunications that leverage the polarization\ndimension have not evolved at the same pace. In particular, these\ncommunications are widely used by satellites, where several streams are\nmultiplexed in each orthogonal polarization. Current communication trends\nadvocate for simplifying and unifying different frameworks in order to increase\nflexibility and address future needs. Due to this, systems that do not require\nchannel information are progressively gaining traction. This dissertation aims\nat challenging this perspective and promoting the use of polarization in new\nradiocommunication systems. Consequently, the goal of this thesis is twofold:\nfirst, we aim at increasing the current capacity of point-to-point and\npoint-to-multipoint links. Secondly, we introduce new mechanisms to increase\nthe robustness of communications in particularly hostile environments. In this\ncontext, this thesis advocates for the use of polarization as a dimension to be\nexploited in radiocommunications. In addition to the use of polarization, index\nmodulations help increase transmission rates whilst improving robustness\nagainst errors and imperfections with a low computational complexity. Thus, the\nstudy of polarization in these systems is essential. This dissertation explores\nprimordial aspects in this area, such as channel capacity, transmitter and\nreceiver design and performance benchmarking with current systems.

This\nnoise introduction can be modeled as a type of protocol composition, i.e., a\nprobabilistic choice among different protocols, and its effect on the amount of\nleakage depends heavily on whether or not this choice is visible to the\nattacker.

We\nthen formalize the interplay between defender and attacker in a game-theoretic\nframework adapted to the specific issues of QIF, where the payoff is\ninformation leakage. We consider various kinds of leakage games, depending on\nwhether players act simultaneously or sequentially, and on whether or not the\nchoices of the defender are visible to the attacker. In the case of sequential\ngames, the choice of the second player is generally a function of the choice of\nthe first player, and his/her probabilistic choice can be either over the\npossible functions (mixed strategy) or it can be on the result of the function\n(behavioral strategy). We show that when the attacker moves first in a\nsequential game with a hidden choice, then behavioral strategies are more\nadvantageous for the defender than mixed strategies. This contrasts with the\nstandard game theory, where the two types of strategies are equivalent.\nFinally, we establish a hierarchy of these games in terms of their information\nleakage and provide methods for finding optimal strategies (at the points of\nequilibrium) for both attacker and defender in the various cases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Mar 2018 12:36:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 May 2018 04:24:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-22", "authors_parsed": [["Alvim", "M\u00e1rio S.", ""], ["Chatzikokolakis", "Konstantinos", ""], ["Kawamoto", "Yusuke", ""], ["Palamidessi", "Catuscia", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.10108", "submitter": "Zbyn\\v{e}k Koldovsk\\'y", "authors": "Zbyn\\v{e}k Koldovsk\\'y and Petr Tichavsk\\'y", "title": "Gradient Algorithms for Complex Non-Gaussian Independent\n  Component/Vector Extraction, Question of Convergence", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TSP.2018.2887185", "report-no": null, "categories": "eess.SP cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We revise the problem of extracting one independent component from an\ninstantaneous linear mixture of signals.

The effective capacity\n(EC) of the UDN is derived, taking into account small-scale channel fading and\npossible interference. Key properties of the EC are revealed. The amount of\ntraffic impacts effective capacity of the UDN due to the sophisticated\ninteractions among small base stations operating in the same frequency. The\nmaximization of total effective capacity is formulated as a non-cooperative\ngame in the paper. The best-response function is derived, iteratively searching\nthe Nash equilibrium point. System simulation results indicate that our\nproposed model is accurate. The simulations also show the maximum allowed\narrival rate with the QoS guarantee, compared with the full interference model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Mar 2018 01:19:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-30", "authors_parsed": [["Gu", "Yu", ""], ["Cui", "Qimei", ""], ["Chen", "Yu", ""], ["Ni", "Wei", ""], ["Tao", "Xiaofeng", ""], ["Zhang", "Ping", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.10994", "submitter": "Mahdi Barzegar Khalilsarai", "authors": "Gerhard Wunder, Ingo Roth, Axel Flinth, Mahdi Barzegar, Saeid\n  Haghighatshoar, Giuseppe Caire, Gitta Kutyniok", "title": "Hierarchical Sparse Channel Estimation for Massive MIMO", "comments": "8 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The problem of wideband massive MIMO channel estimation is considered.\nTargeting for low complexity algorithms as well as small training overhead, a\ncompressive sensing (CS) approach is pursued.
