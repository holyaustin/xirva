To download files from arxiv using amazon s3

s3cmd get --recursive --skip-existing s3://arxiv/pdf/ --requester-pays

To do : 
- [] Fix data for category/yearmonth to be able to display it nicely


It is going to be obviously difficult to upload everything... 
You still gonna have probably around a quarter of all the files tomorrow morning. Start doing the work as if you had them all :)
